# Now you can buy govt bonds via RBI. Here’s how
- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in February said it will open up government bonds for small investors under ‘RBI Retail Direct’,
- and released guidelines for the scheme on Monday. RBI may notify the date of commencement of the scheme soon. Mint explains:

### What’s the RBI Retail Direct scheme?
- Individual investors can open Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) Accounts with RBI to buy government bonds.
- The bonds on offer are government securities (G-Secs) issued by the central government, state development loans that are bonds issued by state governments,
- and sovereign gold bonds issued by the central government but whose price is linked to gold.
- You can buy and hold these bonds to maturity, earning regular interest.
- You can also sell the bonds before maturity in the secondary market. Since they are issued by central and state governments, the default risk is extremely low.

### So how does this scheme work?
- The investor has to open an account with the central bank on a dedicated portal, using a one-time password sent to his or her email address or mobile number.
- The investor needs to have a savings account with a bank in India, a permanent account number and an officially valid document such as a driving licence, voter’s identity card or Aadhaar.
- Non-resident Indians are also allowed to invest in some government bonds.
- Investors can link their bank accounts to the retail direct scheme and pay for their purchases through net banking or unified payments interface.

### What’s the tax position on government  bonds?
- Unlike small saving schemes of the Union government such as the Public Provident Fund or National Savings Certificate,
- there are no special tax benefits on direct purchase of government bonds.
- The interest on such bonds is taxed at your slab rate.
- Holding the same bonds indirectly through a mutual fund can be more tax-efficient.
- The interest accruing from the bonds with the mutual fund gets added to its net asset value and you do not get taxed until you redeem the units.

### What if one wants to exit before maturity?
- RBI has allowed retail investors access to its Negotiated Dealing System (NDS)-Order Matching (OM).
- Ordinarily, government bonds on this system are transacted in lots of ₹5 crore.
- However, RBI has given individuals access to the ‘odd lot’ segment on which bonds of less than ₹5 crore can also be traded.
- The minimum investment size for government securities has been set at ₹10,000 by RBI in this odd lot segment.
- You can sell bonds on NDS-OM before maturity.
- But liquidity in this ‘odd lot’ segment tends to be poor.

### How do retail investors buy bonds on this system?
- You can buy government bonds in primary auctions, where the central and state governments sell their securities in the debt market.
- RBI has allowed retail investors to go for ‘non-competitive bidding’.
- This means you can submit bids without specifying a price.
- The bonds get allotted to you at a price established by competitive bidding among institutions.
