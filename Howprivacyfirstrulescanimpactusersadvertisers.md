# How privacy first rules can impact users, advertisers
- Technology giants are strengthening privacy protections for their users, making it harder for advertisers to track them online.
- The intense regulatory effort worldwide is forcing many firms to review advertising policies meant to serve targeted digital ads. Mint explores.

### What are the new policies?
- On 4 June, Google LLC said it would provide Android users an option to stop apps from tracking them across the internet.
- This came months after it said it would do away with third-party cookies on its Chrome browser from early 2022, and stop tracking users based on their email addresses.
- The company took the cue from Apple Inc., which was the first to halt data tracking with iOS 14.5.
- Apple has also stopped third-party cookie tracking on its Safari browser.
- In contrast, WhatsApp’s data sharing policy update aims at sharing information on people’s interactions with businesses on the app with parent Facebook Inc.

### How have privacy laws worked so far?
- In India, although the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) is yet to be passed by Parliament,
- the IT ministry’s tough stand on WhatsApp’s data sharing policy sent a strong message to tech platforms to get their act together on user privacy.
- Globally, stringent privacy laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have set the benchmark high, forcing technology firms to review data policies.
- These laws highlighted the need to see personal devices such as smartphones as tools to profile individuals online, requiring regulations to control the use of phone data.

### How can advertisers realign themselves?
- The evolving online privacy landscape has provided advertisers an opportunity to reduce their dependence on third-party tech platforms and start building their relationship with customers.
- Firms need to invest in building their own customer data across platforms.
- They can try and harvest market research and aggregated anony-mized data to enrich their first-party data pool.
- These steps will help them bridge the gap between consumer insights and marketing implementation once privacy first policies are fully implemented.

### What  will  be  the impact on the market?
- Being an Android-dominated market, Google’s decision to allow an opt-out option to users for data tracking on apps and third-party cookie advertising is likely to impact India’s ₹17,000-crore digital advertising market.
- However, it is too early to ascertain the exact scale of the impact.
- Additionally, unlike its counterparts in Europe and the US, users in India are still discovering the implications of online privacy, which requires consistent and large-scale awareness drives.

### How do they affect users and platforms?
- Users will get the option to decide whether they wish to share their personal data with an advertiser.
- They will no longer be followed by pesky online ads served through retargeting across websites.
- Users are also expected to see more personalized and relevant campaigns.
- Meanwhile, firms are likely to lose some revenue as they shift to different ways of serving targeted ads.
