# What Coinbase’s IPO holds for the future of cryptos
- US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange last week, sparking another rally in cryptocurrency prices worldwide.
- Mint explains the significance of the listing, how it could change perceptions, and what it means for the industry in India.

### Why is the Coinbase IPO important?
- Coinbase, founded in 2012, is said to be the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange as far as converting cryptocurrency to regular currency is concerned.
- The company started trading on the Nasdaq on 14 April at a valuation of almost $100 billion.
- The public listing is expected to boost the credibility of crypto trading and traders,
- who have faced pushback from governments all over the world, including in India.
- Publicly listed companies are subject to certain regulations and disclosures, increasing trust in what they do, and the sectors where they operate.

### How did the industry react to its listing?
- Prices of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which have been climbing steadily in the last year, hit new records as Coinbase went public.
- Bitcoin hit a record $63,000 (approximately ₹46 lakh) ahead of Coinbase’s listing, and was around the same level at the time of writing.
- Some say the Coinbase listing will be like a Netscape moment for cryptocurrencies worldwide, which sparked the dotcom boom back in the early 1990s.
- Even so, cryptocurrency prices before and after the listing do not tell the whole story. Many crypto enthusiasts were disappointed with the Coinbase listing.

### What does it mean for the industry in India?
- India is expected to enforce a complete ban on cryptocurrencies.
- The listing gives India’s crypto industry another point to add in the representations they have been making to the government, to reconsider its ban.
- As recently as March, Coinbase selected Hyderabad to set up its physical offices in India, and is expected to create technology jobs in the country.
- Crypto investors in India have invested billions in crypto assets over the past few months alone, and Coinbase’s IPO will give them more confidence.

### What is India’s stance on cryptocurrencies?
- The Indian government was expected to introduce a bill in the recently concluded Parliament session, banning all crypto dealings in the country.
- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had also restricted banks from dealing with crypto companies back in 2018,
- a ruling that was struck down by the Supreme Court last year.
- Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said in the past that the government is considering a “calibrated approach” to cryptocurrencies in India.

### Why are some crypto enthusiasts disappointed?
- Many see the listing as a fundamental move away from the original promise of cryptocurrencies—that of putting the public back in control of money.
- While the listing lends legitimacy to the industry, it also brings crypto investors into the purview of regulations.
- This, for many, negates what cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems were meant for.
