# How will PM Gati Shakti expedite infra projects?
- Prime minister Narendra Modi on Thursday unveiled the PM Gati Shakti-National Master Plan for multimodal connectivity
- that he first spoke of from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day earlier this year. Mint explains.

### What is PM Gati Shakti master plan all about?
- The PM Gati Shakti aims to break inter-ministerial silos in infrastructure development.
- It will be achieved through integrated planning and coordinated implementation between different government departments.
- Two defence corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh will be set up.
- In the last few years, work to establish four industrial corridors has begun as well.
- The government’s thinking is that by planning and building the trunk infrastructure through the Gati Shakti,
- such industrial corridors can be made ready for plug-and-play for industries to quickly start operations.

### How is the Gati Shakti different  from the NIP?
- The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), worth ₹110 trillion,
- is a list of social and infrastructure projects that the government plans to build by 2025.
- The Gati Shakti will form the digital backbone up on which the infrastructure projects will be implemented.
- All projects will be on this digital plat-form built by the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG-N).
- From stakeholder coordination to key last-mile connectivity, every aspect of the planning will be dealt by the master plan.
- It may ensure that the Centre does not lose money or time due to the lack of coordination.

### How will the master plan be implemented?
- The government will create a new institutional mechanism to coordinate the implementation of the master plan.
- A network planning group (NPG) of technical experts from each of the 16 infrastructure ministries
- will examine projects of infrastructure connectivity that cost more than ₹500 crore included under multimodal infrastructure classification.
- The projects cleared by the NPG will be sent to an Empowered Group of Secretaries headed by cabinet secretary for further scrutiny and approval.

### Can it be explained through an example?
- Let’s say an integrated industrial township is planned at Dadri in Greater Noida.
- It will have to be linked to ports through dedicated freight corridors.
- This needs a multimodal logistics hub close by.
- It will have a modern railway terminus, further supported by a mass rapid transit system.
- All this requires planning and coordination from different departments.
- With similar facilities in different parts of the country, the government believes it can make manufacturing more competitive.

### What does this mean for logistics costs in India?
- India’s logistics costs are very high, at around 13% of its gross domestic product (GDP)—it makes most industries in India less competitive internationally.
- Smoother transportation will reduce logistics costs and make exports more competitive.
- Farmers also lose out on opportunities to export due to weak transport linkages.
- Seamless last-mile connectivity will greatly help.
