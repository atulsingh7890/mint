# Why people are excited about Bored Ape NFTs
- A collection of 10,000 digital images of apes has amassed sales worth millions of dollars in 2021.
- Sold as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Bored Ape NFTs are actually part of a bigger NFT buying trend.
- Mint explains this new investment trend.

### What are Bored Ape NFTs?
- The 10,000 digital images of the apes are basically avatars that you can use online.
- All 10,000 are different images, with each ape being dressed differently, having different expressions and so on.
- They come from a website called Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and are developed by a company called Yuga Labs.
- Buying one of these NFTs gives the buyer access to this club, including access to “The Bathroom”, a digital graffiti board akin to a dive bar bathroom.
- The collection launched on 30 April and has amassed over $600 million in sales till date, according to Dappradar, a decentralized apps tracker.

### Who created the Bored Ape Yacht Club?
- Like the founder of Bitcoin, the creators of Bored Apes and Yuga Labs also chose to hide their real identities behind pseudonyms — Gordon Goner, Gargamel, No Sass, and Emperor Tomato Ketchup.
- According to interviews with various publications, Gordon Goner is the “chief Ape” in this business.
- Their website says that one of their first goals was to “pay back our moms”, which could be an indicator of their age.
- The NFT universe is no stranger to younger audiences.
- For instance, 13-year-old Indian artist Laya Mathiraksha has sold NFTs worth lakhs of rupees on the WazirX NFT platform.

### Why do people buy Bored Ape?
- Basketball superstar Stephen Curry bought one of these apes in August and used it as his Twitter profile picture.
- Buying a BAYC NFT also gives owners access to the company’s Discord server, which is basically a chat platform that includes celebrities like Curry.
- For many, putting up an ape as their profile picture is sort of a status symbol, signifying their membership in this somewhat exclusive digital club.
- At least two other well known basketball players have bought these NFTs too.

### Is BAYC a one-of-a-kind project?
- No, selling digital avatars is a practice that started long ago.
- A project called CryptoPunks has amassed billions since it began in 2017.
- It contains 10,000 uniquely generated digital characters and is run by a company called Larva Labs.
- Digital avatars are expected to be an essential source of commerce in the future metaverse envisioned by technologists like Mark Zuckerberg.
- NFTs represent ownership of a digital item, and virtual avatars of a person will be tagged to their accounts using this medium.

### How did the Bored Ape become popular?
- Shortly after minting their first NFTs, a collection of 101 Bored Ape NFTs was picked up by auction house Sotheby’s and sold for a whopping $24.4 million.
- Christie’s sold another batch for $12 million in September.
- Publication Rolling Stone partnered with Yuga Labs earlier this week for a 20-page limited edition magazine with BAYC artwork.
