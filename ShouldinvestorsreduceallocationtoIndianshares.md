# Should investors reduce allocation to Indian shares?
- As India comes further into the grip of the second wave and curbs get extended or imposed in more and more areas,
- the economic cost of the disease will impact corporate earnings.
- This may cause the Indian market to underperform global peers, at least in the near term.

### What is tactical portfolio allocation?
- Tactical investing is a relatively short-term response to an investing opportunity.
- A tactical investor identifies a trend early in its life and takes advantage of the trend.
- By contrast, long-term investing tailors your portfolio to your financial goals, time horizon and risk appetite—for example, a high debt allocation for someone close to retirement.
- Several investors also adopt a combination of tactical investing and long-term goal-based investing.
- For example, they might overweight a market or asset class by 10-15% and correspondingly underweight another, without straying a great deal from their long-term portfolio.


### Why might India be a tactical sell?
- Even as India records the highest number of covid-19 cases in the world, the stock market has so far only seen a mild correction.
- As the graph of cases continues to rise and various restrictions get extended, market expectations of a short and low-impact covid wave may give way to a more pessimistic outlook on corporate earnings.
- A number of brokerages have downgraded India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
- Nomura has downgraded India’s GDP growth from 13.5% to 12.6%, while JPMorgan has cut its forecast from 13% to 11%. Investors in Indian equities may be in for a rough ride.

### What alternatives do Indian investors have?
- A number of mutual fund houses have made global indices available to Indian investors through index funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).
- This includes the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.
- For those who prefer actively managed mutual funds, there are a number of funds tracking the US, Europe, and even other emerging markets.
- A second alternative is to invest in these markets through the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the RBI through which you can remit up to $250,000 per year.

### Are there sectors that can provide refuge?
- Sectors, such as information technology (IT) and pharmaceuticals, are more oriented towards global than Indian markets.
- IT workers can more easily transition to a work from home environment than, for instance, manufacturing.
- However, these stocks have already seen a huge rally over the past year.
- The Nifty IT index is up 99.82% over the past year compared to 57.37% for the broader Nifty Index (as of 23 April).
- Their valuations may already have captured some of the divergence.

### What role does the currency play?
- When a country’s economy weakens, its central bank tries to stimulate the economy by loosening monetary policy.
- This usually weakens the currency against foreign currencies.
- The rupee has dropped by around 3% in April as the second wave gathered base.
- The RBI has amassed large foreign exchange reserves, but it may allow the rupee to fall further to help exports.
