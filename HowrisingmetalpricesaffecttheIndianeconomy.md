# How rising metal prices affect the Indian economy
- Metal prices are on a tear as investors bet on global economic recovery amid supply side constraints.
- China’s benchmark iron ore futures surged 10% to a record high on Monday. Mint looks at the reasons behind the rally.


### Why are metal prices increasing?
- Globally, demand is outpacing supply because of economic recovery with improving manufacturing and
-  better demand forecast for electric vehicles where copper—prices of which have gained 34% on the London Metal Exchange (LME) this year—is a key ingredient. 
-  Both ferrous and non-ferrous metals have rallied.
-  However, domestic steel prices are at a discount to both landed price of imports from China (20%) and export price (11%).
-  Global crude steel production grew 15% year-on-year in March 2021, mainly due to a low base.
-  Iron ore supply is unable to keep up with demand for high- grade iron ore in China.

### Will rising metal prices lead to more inflation?
- Though analysts expect a strong operating environment for metals to sustain for at least another two to three months, higher metal prices will lead to higher WPI (wholesale price index) inflation.
- Since India is not a big importer of metals and Indian companies follow world metal prices, the price rise will push the input cost for Indian companies,
-  pushing WPI up, as companies may not want to absorb the cost given the covid-19 pandemic-induced stress on their balance sheets.
-  Domestic iron ore price is still at a discount of 48% to international price.

### Will this impact infra development?
- According to analysts, an across-the-board rise in prices is leading to input cost pressures, impacting the cost of infrastructure development.
- Metal prices are getting a push from the recovery in China and the US, and analysts expect this bull run in commodities to extend.
- Steel, the most common metal used across sectors, is at a record high and is expected to continue its trajectory.
- The spike in metal prices is worrying for the construction/infrastructure industry as India is spending big on infrastructure development.

### Will metal prices aid steel firms in India?
- Exploding metal prices are helping Indian steel companies deleverage their balance sheet and repay debt at a quicker pace.
- Tata Steel’s net debt declined to ₹75,389 crore at the end of March 2021.
- During 2020-21, it made a repayment of ₹29,390 crore, with ₹10,781 crore in the March quarter.
- SAIL reduced gross debt by ₹16,150 crore.
- Jindal Steel and Power has reduced debt from a peak of ₹46,500 crore in December 2016 to ₹25,600 crore in December 2020.

### Will commodity inflation hit other sectors?
- Auto, real estate and infrastructure companies are likely to bear the maximum brunt.
- Bajaj Auto’s commodity input costs rose 4-5% in the March quarter, while the company has made hikes of 4%.
- Maruti Suzuki is substantially raising prices of its products.
- Tata Motors has increased the prices of its passenger vehicles by 1.8% average.
