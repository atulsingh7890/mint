# What  slow credit growth means for the economy
- India was not spared by the sweep of pandemic.
- The government and the central bank took several steps to give the requisite boost to the economy.
- But India’s credit growth rate slowed further in 2020-21, while deposit growth rate continued to rise. Mint explores.

### The trend in credit and deposit growth rates
- As per the Financial Stability Report of January 2021, year-on-year (y-o-y) credit growth of scheduled commercial banks was slowing down even before the pandemic.
- Credit growth rate in March 2020 was at 5.7%, which fell further to 5.0% by September 2020.
- On the other hand, deposit growth remained healthy at 10.3%, thanks to precautionary savings by people influenced by the virus-induced uncertainty.
- With signs of a probable V-shaped recovery, credit growth in the second quarter of FY21 did see an uptick at 6.2%;
- however, with the onslaught of the second wave, things might take another gloomy turn.

### What does falling credit growth suggest?
- Slowing credit growth rate was based on low demand for credit.
- With business confidence dipping (65.5 in Q2 2021 and 84.8 in Q3FY21 as per the NCAER),
- business sentiments relative to the previous year were still negative at -23.7% on a y-o-y basis relative to Q3FY20.
- Despite credit offtake in Q3FY21 and financial institutions largely cushioned by plentiful liquidity,
- overall capacity utilization was still lower at 72.8% as the investment climate in general was not encouraging.
- Growth in new loans in Q2FY21 was seen mainly in agriculture, while new loans availed by the industry and services sectors were still negative.

### The sectoral credit deployment picture
- Though non-food bank credit growth rate at 6.5% in February 2021 was up from 5.7% in January 2021,
- it reflected discouraging credit disbursal when compared with the 7.3% growth in February 2020.
- Credit disbursal to the agriculture sector continued rising, while that to industry contracted.
- Within the industry sector, credit to food processing, beverages and tobacco, textiles, gems and jewellery, glass and glassware registered accelerated growth in February 2021 compared to February 2020.

### The implication on macroeconomy
- India Inc. perhaps started relying more on alternative sources of funds such as debt instruments or has probably put capex on hold.
- For banks, it would mean reduced opportunity to recover cost of banking operations and earn profits.
- Falling credit-deposit ratio may lead to the development of a situation soon where Indian business units may look for a competitive interest rate regime.
- It is also time for the RBI to focus on cost of loans rather than liquidity.


### What does increasing deposit growth rate mean?
- Uncertainty about future economic prospects has resulted in increased precautionary savings leading to deposit growth rate outpacing bank credit growth rate.
- Even with CPI inflation rising to 5.52% in March 2021 and bank deposit rates in the range of 5.0-5.75%,
- the fear of uncertainty looming large has resulted in individuals parking their money in banks.
