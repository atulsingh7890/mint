# Beware of ‘out of pocket’ expenses in health policies
- The covid-19 pandemic has sharply underlined the importance of having a health insurance policy to deal with treatment costs.
- But there are major gaps in the design of such policies—in costs which are not covered. Mint explains the typical gaps and how to fill them.

### What are out of pocket expenses?
- Out of pocket expenses are costs associated with an illness that you pay from your own pocket.
- They are not covered by your health insurance policy.
- For instance, money spent on consumables (such as medicines and PPE kits), deductibles (amount you must pay before the policy kicks in), co-payments (expenses that you must pay alongside the insurer), and sub-limits (such as insurance caps on room rent).
- Therefore, this is something that the insured ends up paying from his or her pocket.
- Media reports suggest that such expenses make up to 30-50% of the total amount spent on covid-19 treatment.

### Why are these expenses so high?
- Today, while providing treatment to patients, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) kit is necessary to contain the spread of covid-19.
- The PPE kit normally includes a pair of nitrile gloves, a single-use coverall, glasses, an N-95 mask, shoe covers and a face shield.
- Since each of these items is separately considered as a consumable, there is a significant increase in the number of consumables used in the treatment of diseases such as covid-19.
- In addition, your insurance policy may not cover all diseases, and it may have high deductibles or sub limits such as caps on room rent.

### How can you take care of such expenses?
- Careful selection will cut down your out of pocket expenses, but no insurance policy is going to take care of all expenses.
- So build an emergency corpus of 6-12 months of expenses in a savings account, fixed deposit, or liquid fund.
- Consider topping up your emergency corpus if you already have one.
- If you do not have an emergency corpus, you will have to liquidate assets.
- As a very last resort, you can borrow money, but avoid taking on credit card debt.
- A loan against property or a personal loan will have lower interest rate.

### What can you do to  minimize expenses?
- Buy a comprehensive health policy with low deductibles and exclusions to minimize the overall treatment cost.
- Review the insurance coverage every year and top it up as medical costs increase.
- While taking treatment, you should go with the network hospitals of the insurer.
- Ask for options for the recommended tests or procedures and over the counter medicines.
- Carefully check the medical bills—some hospitals may tend to overcharge for various procedures and insurers reject such claims.

### What is not covered under a health insurance?
- Generally, insurers don’t provide coverage for any pre-existing diseases (PEDs) for 2 to 4 years when buying a health policy.
- These include high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid, asthma and even covid-19.
- Other common exclusions are maternity benefits, cosmetic surgery, dental surgery, joint replacement, etc.
- Also, outpatient treatment isn’t covered by insurers.
