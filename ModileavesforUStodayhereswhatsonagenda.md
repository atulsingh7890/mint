# Modi leaves for US today; here’s what’s on agenda
- Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for the US on a three-day visit on Wednesday,
- with stops in Washington and New York.
- This is his first foreign trip since March last year when he visited Bangladesh. Mint unpacks his visit:

### What’ll  be the highlight of Modi’s US visit?
- One of the key events in the US is a meeting of the leaders of the four Quad countries
- the US, India, Japan and Australia—which have common interests—primarily, a free and open Indo-Pacific,
- against the backdrop of China’s military muscle flexing.
- They had held a virtual summit on 12 March when they agreed to boost covid vaccine production for countries in the Indo-Pacific.
- The understanding was that India would manufacture the vaccine, with Hyderabad-based Biological E receiving the nod from Johnson & Johnson.
- Japan would fund the project and Australia would help with distribution of vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region.

### What can be expected from Quad meeting?
- A possible takeaway is an understanding on creating a safe supply chain for semiconductors,
- which would signal that the alliance meant to counter China in the Indo-Pacific is broadening its scope.
- Chinese chip-makers are making aggressive investments to ramp up capacity for widely used semiconductors.
- The Quad may state that “resilient, diverse and secure technology supply chains for hardware, software, and services” are vital to their shared national interests,
- according to Japan’s Nikkei Asia.
- The Quad countries may also announce an infrastructure initiative to take on China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

### What issues are likely in bilateral meetings?
- The situation in Afghanistan, China’s territorial belligerence, the Australia-UK-US pact on nuclear submarines, and climate change are some of the likely issues.
- The need to stem radicalism, cross-border terrorism, dismantling terrorist networks, bolstering defence and trade ties, and exploring cooperation in new and emerging technologies will be on the agenda during talks with Biden, senior officials said.
- With Biden’s interest in climate change, their meeting could see some announcements in this area.

### What’ll  Modi’s  schedule in New York include?
- Modi will reach New York on 24 September, where he will be the first speaker at the 76th UN General Assembly session on 25 September. 
- **"Building resilience through hope”** post the pandemic is one of the themes of the session this year, as is **“revitalizing the UN”**.
- In his speech, Modi is expected to touch on the regional situation
- i.e. Afghanistan, cross-border terrorism, global efforts to combat covid-19, the climate change challenge,
- and the need to reform the UN and other multilateral systems.

### What are Modi’s other engagements in the US?
- Modi is expected to hold bilateral talks with US President Joe Biden, Australian PM Scott Morrison, and Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga.
- The meetings with Biden and Suga will be the first in-person exchanges that Modi will be having with both in their current roles.
- Modi has met Biden at least twice when he was US Vice President in the Obama administration.
