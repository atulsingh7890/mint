# India has more at stake with US set to  exit  Afghanistan
- The US is set to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by 11 September.
- But peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban militants are floundering amid continuing bloodshed.
- No one knows what a future government will look like.
- Mint explains India’s stakes:

### What is the status of the peace talks?
- The peace process has not made much headway mainly because violence by the Taliban continues unabated.
- One of the conditions of the February 2020 US-Taliban deal was a reduction in violence.
- That has not happened, though a temporary ceasefire has come into effect over Eid ul-Fitr. 
- The Taliban strategy seems to be to capture power in Kabul by violence and intimidation despite warnings from the international community.
- The Ashraf Ghani government, which has called for a permanent ceasefire, says it’s willing to schedule early elections to transfer power, an idea opposed by the Taliban.

### The international community’s role
- Many countries have been trying through multiple tracks to kickstart the stalled peace process in Afghanistan.
- A round of talks in Moscow was attended by the US, Russia, China, and Pakistan, besides representatives of Kabul and the Taliban in March this year.
- Another round in Turkey scheduled for April was called off after the Taliban refused to participate in the talks.
- UN-backed talks among Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India, and the US “to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan,” do not seem to be happening.

### What are the stakes for India?
- New Delhi views Afghanistan as a part of its extended neighbourhood and a link to Central Asia.
- But for Pakistan occupying part of Kashmir, India would have had a direct border with Afghanistan.
- Despite claims that the Taliban have changed in the past two decades, there is no proof that it has shed any of its obscurantist ideology.
- A Taliban-controlled government in Kabul would mean Pakistan controlling Afghan policy on India.
- And a repeat of the past when Pakistan used Afghanistan territory for anti-India activities.

### The prospects for peace in Afghanistan
- Poor, given that the US has accommodated Taliban demands as it stays focussed on withdrawing its troops.
- It has looked away from attacks on Afghan targets—including the 9 May attack on a Kabul girls’ school that killed more than 50.
- That the 2020 US-Taliban peace deal happened without a Kabul representative is telling.
- With violence continuing, Afghanistan may slip back into civil war, with warlords cutting deals with the Taliban to control their areas of influence,
- triggering an indefinite period of instability.

### What is New Delhi’s position on the issue?
- India, which has committed $3 billion in development aid and reconstruction activities, backs the Ashraf Ghani government in war-torn country.
- New Delhi wants an “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled” peace process—not one that is remote-controlled by Pakistan, seen as the backers of the Taliban.
