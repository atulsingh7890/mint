# Why black fungus is rearing its ugly head in India now
- Cases of mucormycosis, a serious fungal infection, are rising in India among patients who are either suffering or have recovered from covid-19.
- Commonly called black fungus, it can invade the lungs and brain, and has a high mortality rate. Mint explains:

### What is mucormycosis (black fungus)?
- Mucormycosis is caused by a group of moulds called mucormycetes that are found throughout the natural environment.
- It often affects the sinuses, lungs, skin and brain.
- It mainly affects people who are on medication for other conditions, especially diabetes, that reduce their ability to fight environmental pathogens.
- The sinuses or lungs of such individuals get affected after fungal spores are inhaled from the air.
- Warning signs include fever, headache, coughing, breathlessness, blood vomits and altered mental status.
- Maharashtra has recorded over 2,000 cases.

### Why is it affecting covid-19 patients?
- Patients with uncontrolled diabetes are anyway at high risk of contracting covid-19.
- When this happens, they are treated with steroids which further compromises immunity.
- Doctors in India hold that steroids which are being used as a life-saving treatment for severe and critically ill covid-19 patients, can prove to be a trigger for mucormycosis.
- While steroids help in reducing inflammation in lungs they can decrease immunity and increase blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic covid-19 patients alike. 
- Patients with prolonged ICU stay are also at high risk of mucormycosis.

### What precautions can patients take?
- Covid-19 patients should control hyperglycemia by regularly monitoring their blood glucose level post discharge.
- Diabetics should also monitor their blood glucose levels.
- Doctors have been advised to use antibiotics, antifungals and steroids judiciously.
- Hospitals should use clean, sterile water for humidifiers during oxygen therapy.
- Doctors have been warned not to miss warning signs and symptoms and not lose crucial time to initiate treatment.
- Use masks at dusty construction sites.

### What is the treatment of mucormycosis?
- Patients should control diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Doctors should reduce steroids in case the patient is still on them and discontinue rapidly.
- Immunomodulating drugs should also be discontinued.
- Doctors can go for surgery for removing all necrotic (dead) material.
- Antifungal therapy has also been advised for at least four to six weeks.
- Amphotericin B is being used for treatment, leading to a sudden increase in demand in some states.

### What are the symptoms of mucormycosis?
- The ICMR mentions sinusitis (nasal blockage or congestion), blackish/bloody nasal discharge and pain on the cheek bone.
- Other symptoms include pain on one side of the face, numbness or
- swelling, blackish discolouration over the bridge of nose/palate, loosening of teeth, blurred or double vision with pain, fever, skin lesion, blood clot, and chest pain.
