# How fluctuations in prices impact overall economy
- Retail inflation at 4.3% in April is well within the central bank’s comfort zone of 4% (+/-2%).
- Amid the growing risk that localized curbs might disrupt supply chains,
- consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation dipping to three-month low gives policymakers some breathing space.

### How is inflation measured?
- Inflation is measured by the CPI and the wholesale price index (WPI).
- The CPI measures changes in prices of essential commodities at the consumer level, while the WPI notes changes at the producer level.
- The commodities considered for measuring the WPI are manufactured products (63.75% weightage), primary articles such as food (20.02%), and fuel and power (14.23%).
- For the CPI, the commodities are food and products (45.86%), housing (10.07%), clothing (6.53%), and fuel among others.
- Inflation is indicative of the decreasing purchasing power of the country’s currency and vice versa.

### How do price changes impact an economy?
- Inflation increases the cost of production, which is passed on to consumers.
- With the WPI rising to 10.49% in April as against 7.39% in March, cost push pressures have been witnessed.
- Cost push pressures hit purchasing power that results in a fall in the standard of living.
- Inflation also results in increasing project costs.
- Employers then have to compensate this through variable pay such as dearness allowance if the trend in the WPI gets extended to the CPI too.
- On the other hand, demand pull inflation incentivises produ-cers to make more.
- Rising inflation is an advantage for borrowers and disadvantage for lenders.

### What is the relevance for monetary policy?
- As a monetary policy objective, the RBI started inflation targeting of 4% (+/- 2%) since 2016.
- In increasing inflationary conditions, the RBI adopts a contractionary monetary policy.
- In case of a slow-down, it adopts an expansionary monetary policy, which leads to increased money supply, lower interest rates, lower borrowing costs, and increasing aggregate demand thereby giving a boost to the economy.
- But, due to covid, the past one year has been an exception for inflation targeting as economic revival got precedence.

### Is a fall in inflation rate always good?
- If a fall is because of decreasing demand, it is not a good sign.
- Other than declining food prices, fall in price levels in April can also be attributed to subdued economic activity because of the lockdowns.
- People lost their means of income, resulting in a fall in demand and pushing down price levels.
- Besides, data collection in April and May was disrupted, leading to the base not being reflective of accurate trends.
- A healthy rise in the price level of 4% is good.


### What is the political impact of inflation?
- Increasing price levels, especially for essential items, around election time could destabilize the incumbent government.
- The ruling party is thus always sensitive to inflation.
- On the other hand, a slower increase in price levels especially fruits and vegetables means worsening terms of trade for farmers, again impacting the government.
