# Where do India’s tech regulations stand at present?
- India’s upcoming technology regulations are back in focus with new ministers taking charge at the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity).
- They will have their task cut out in easing tensions between the government and big tech firms. Mint explains:

### What tech regulations is India working on?
- With the IT rules out of the way, India has three big technology regulations in the works.
- These include a Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill that is akin to the European General Data Privacy Regulation and will set the stage for how big technology firms operate in the country;
- a National Cybersecurity Strategy with 80 deliverables that provide for data security and may also have an impact on the country’s telecom sector;
- and a cryptocurrency bill that regulates the future of digital currencies in the country.
- The cryptocurrency bill may also set the framework for a central bank digital currency in India.

### What is the status of these regulations?
- A draft of the PDP Bill was seen in 2019.
- A Data Protection Authority will be formed and will take steps to protect the interest of individuals in India, according to the draft.
- But the bill has been criticized for possibly bestowing too much power on government agencies, which could be misused.
- Newly appointed minister of state Rajeev Chandrasekhar had said in December that the bill won’t be cleared in its current form.
- On the other hand, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the government will take a “calibrated” approach to crypto,
- though fears remain that the upcoming bill might ban crypto trading in India.

### When could these rules be introduced?
- The IT rules are already in effect, but the other three are yet to come.
- National cybersecurity coordinator Rajesh Pant has said the cyber-security strategy will be introduced later this year,
- while the finance minister has said the cabinet note for the crypto bill is ready, raising expectations that it will be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament.
- A parliamentary panel had been deliberating on the PDP Bill for a long time and had asked for an extension during the budget session in March.
- It received the extension till the monsoon session.

### What does the cabinet reshuffle mean?
- Many industry experts say the cabinet reshuffle may be a good thing for the future of regulations.
- Chandrasekhar has been close to the technology sector during his career and is said to understand its intricacies well.
- He also founded BPL Mobile in 1994, which was the largest mobile network operator at the time.
- Ashwini Vaishnaw, the IT minister, is an alumnus of IIT Kanpur.
- It is believed that his first task would be to ease the tensions between the Union government and big technology companies.

### Is internet the only part of India’s tech regulations?
- India has also been trying to attract electronics manufacturers to India.
- It has already introduced production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for mobile and IT hardware manufacturing
- and is working on a plan to attract semiconductor and display manufacturers to India.
- These could significantly impact the exports of electronic goods.
