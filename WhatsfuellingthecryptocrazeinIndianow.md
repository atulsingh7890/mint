# What’s fuelling the crypto craze in India now?
- The entry of Bollywood actors and cricketers has rekindled interest in cryptocurrencies in the country.
- But where does a cryptocurrency really get its value from? Should you be investing in every new token? Mint explains:

### What are the new crypto tokens?
- India is no stranger to crypto-currencies, but two new tokens have recently gained interest from users.
- The first is a token called $GARI from short-video platform Chingari, which the company says is a social token that will be used to help creators run their own e-commerce operations, create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more.
- The other is called Bolly, which is the cryptocurrency for a Bollywood-only NFT marketplace called BollyCoin, started by director Atul Agnihotri.
- Both tokens were promoted by actor Salman Khan and have received interest from both the crypto community and users alike.

### Are these the only new tokens and platforms?
- At the moment, yes, but India is no stranger to cryptocurrencies at this point.
- In fact, the country’s top cryptocurrency exchange WazirX lists six cryptocurrencies from Indian firms at the moment.
- At least two of these — WazirX and MATIC — have hit billion-dollar valuations in the past.
- At the time of writing, MATIC had a market capitalization of over $10 billion.
- As reported by Mint earlier, a plethora of other cryptocurrencies are also expected to come from India in the next few months to a year.
- In addition, more than seven new NFT marketplaces have been opened in the country in 2021 alone.

### What are cryptos being used for in India?
- Most individuals are investing in cryptos to take advantage of their volatile prices and make money.
- But experts say platforms and firms mostly use them as a mechanism for raising funds and for marketing their platforms and services.
- In fact, experts warn users against putting their money in these new cryptocurrencies, citing the lack of clarity in their white papers,
- and the fact that they have many more use cases than simply raising funds or marketing a platform.
- They say retail investors could incur losses by chasing such tokens.

### What other use cases are there?
- Cryptos aren’t simply meant to be tradeable assets.
- They power blockchain platforms, which can be used to build new applications.
- This is where their value comes from.
- For instance, the Ethereum platform is valuable because it allows developers to build a variety of decentralized apps on top of it, including financial, messaging, social media apps, games, and more.
- Similarly, Polygon allows platforms to reduce transaction fees.
- Experts say a cryptocurrency that’s tied to a single platform will not have value in the long run.

### How popular is crypto in the country?
- In October, comparison platform BrokerChooser said at 100.7 million, India has the highest number of crypto holders in the world.
- The country has mostly gained from growing trading volumes on crypto exchanges,
- but recent interest in NFT from celebrities, Bollywood actors, and cricketers has also inspired curiosity.
