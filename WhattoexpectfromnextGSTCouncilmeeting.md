# What to expect from next GST Council meeting
- Federal indirect tax body, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council will hold its 45th meeting in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, on Friday.
- Mint takes a look at the issues that are expected to come up for discussions at the meeting:

### How significant is the next  GST  Council  meet?
- This will be the first in-person meeting of political leaders at the federal tax body since the coronavirus outbreak.
- In the last few meetings, political differences between the Centre and some non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) states
- had become more pronounced in the council over issues such as GST compensation,
- the Centre’s reliance on various types of cess for revenue collection,
- the extent of tax relief on covid-related medical supplies
- and the rules issued by a panel of bureaucrats in the periods between two meetings of the Council.
- This meeting is seen as an opportunity to mend fences.

### What  are  the  key issues this time?
- The GST council is expected to deliberate on the demands from state governments for extending GST compensation,
- which was constitutionally guaranteed for five years, beyond June 2022.
- Analysis of the GST revenue positions of the central and state governments,
- judicial pronouncements requiring policy action and possible extension of covid-related tax relief could figure in the meeting.
- Certain anomalies where tax outgo on raw materials
- exceeding that on finished products—known as inverted duty structure—are also likely to figure in the meeting.

### How  will  compensation after 2022 be decided?
- The constitutional guarantee for GST compensation up to 2022 is based on a formula which calculates the state revenue to be protected by the Centre.
- The protected revenue goes up 14% a year over the base year of 2015-16.
- The gap between revenue collected by the state and the protected revenue is given as compensation.
- But with the realization within the Central government that a 14% annual increase in protected revenue may not be viable in current circum-stances,
- the formula is likely to be revised for the period beyond 2022.

### Any other unfinished agenda items?
- Many. Inclusion of petroleum products in GST is a long-pending issue.
- Petroleum products being a big source of revenue for both central and state governments, their inclusion will spark long debates.
- The inclusion of Jet fuel and natural gas could face less opposition.
- Experts said it is also necessary, in addition to a discussion on extending the tenure of the compensation cess,
- to focus on correcting the inverted duty structure on certain products.
- This tax anomaly is particularly evident in textiles, fertilizers, and footwear.

### What’s the compensation issue all about?
- The economic downturn and the pandemic have affected state revenues, reducing their ability to spend.
- GST compensation has been an important component in most state budgets.
- States are also burdened with the additional requirement of offering economic and welfare packages to vulnerable sections of society,
- make capital spending and rev up economic growth.
