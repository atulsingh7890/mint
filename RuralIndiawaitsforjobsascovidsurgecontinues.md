# Rural India waits for jobs as covid surge continues
- The number of people registering for jobs under MGNREGS has increased to 40 million in April from 36 million in March 2021.
- This rise in demand for rural jobs can be attributed to the second wave of covid-19, which has hit India badly and resulted in reverse migration.

### How does the scheme benefit the economy?
- The Indian economy is known to be domestic consumption-led: 80% of the gross domestic product relies upon the domestic market.
- With nearly 65% of people living in rural areas, increased and continuous demand among the rural population has boosted the economy in times of crisis.
- During the 2008-09 sub-prime crisis, the economy was insulated from the global financial crisis due to the rural purchasing power brought by the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.
- Recovery from the first wave of the pandemic was faster than expected mainly due to a resilient rural economy.

### What are scheme’s major objectives?
- The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, guarantees 100 days of employment in a fiscal to adults in rural households willing to undertake unskilled labour.
- This is based on the principles of the Keynesian theory that during a downturn, governments can help generate employment and push demand by putting money in people’s hands.
- The scheme, which aims to generate employment and build infrastructure, ensures that productive economic activities are undertaken.
- Over the years, governments have interwoven the scheme with technology and increased it’s efficiency.

### And how should the society respond?
- MGNREGS should continue only as a buffer.
- The need of the hour is for other stakeholders—especially manufacturing units—to build infrastructure that takes care of migrants during crises.
- Employers may expand their HR horizon by keeping migrant labourers gainfully employed.
- This may require housing, healthcare facilities and keeping their kitchens working.
- The Centre may devise similar job opportunities for the urban poor, thus minimizing reverse migration.


### What is the trend in demand for jobs under MGNREGA?
- In view of the recent lockdowns, many rating agencies have revised Indian GDP forecasts.
- Nomura, for instance, rejigged the GDP for FY22 to 11.5% from 12.4%.
- The first wave saw a spike in demand for jobs in MGNREGS due to reverse migration, touching record highs in May, June 2020.
- The number of registrations has doubled from the year-ago period in second wave.

### What is the economic significance of this?
- A rising trend in demand for rural employment is an indicator of proportionate labour shortage in industrial units, both in organized and small-scale sectors.
- States are working to minimize curbs to ensure continued activity.
- But the purpose may get defeated if they are not able to retain migrant labourers whose role is crucial for the economy.
- On the other hand, it is also an opportunity for a long-term developmental strategy by upskilling migrants and facilitating intrastate employment, especially in UP, Bihar and West Bengal.
