As the second wave of covid-19 rages in India, it is essentail to speed up vaccinations. With universal adult vaccination involving states and the private sector starting on 1 May, there is a big likelihood of a vaccine shortage. 

## The Vaccination Challenge
The number of vaccine doses being administered in the country has come down from 25 million in week 12 to less than 17 million in week 15(ended 30 April). Now, with the opening of adult vaccination, there is a big likelihood of vaccine shortage. 

### What is the cause of the likely shortage ?
- 149.32 doses administered till 30th April.
    - Dose 1 : 123.84 million
    - Dose 2 : 25.48 million
- From May 1, 1878 million doses will be required.
    - Two Doses for 939 million adults.
- India has only two vaccines
    - Locally Developed
    - With a License
- Both can make 80-90 million doses per month.
- Both may expand to approx 160 million does per month by July.
- There is an evident demand supply gap.

### What are the Intellectual Property Rights(IPRs) ?
- Member of WTO have agreed to provide patent protection for any invention.
- Invention can be Production(e.g Medicine) or Process(method of Producing).
- Previoulsly, IRPs of Products used to be protected through the Process Patent under Indian Patent Act, 1970.
- That allowed the manufacture of a patented product by other by a differnt Process.
- This was the reason Indian Medicines once were cheapest utill WTO regime in the mid-1990s.
- Currently, WTO's strict patent rules prevent other firms to manufacture the same Product using a different Process.


### What is the economic significance of vaccination ?
- It may not end Pandemic but has big impact on human psychology.
- Despite supportive fiscal and monetary policies, India's economy is yet to return to normalcy.
- Behavioural factors have been impacting both sides ( Demand & Supply).
- It is expected that Vaccine will reduce the number and severity of cases , producing a positive impact.


### How will licensing provisions help ?
- Its is advisable to invole other drug makers in vaccine manufacturing by invoking the compulsory licensing provision under the original Indian Patent Act, defunct since mid-1990s.
- Government should invoke the provision allow other manufacturers to produce patented product or use the Process without the Permission of the patent owner.
- License can be given to another manufacturer as the society's right is predominant.

### What's the alternative at the level of WTO ?
- WTO shold be pressurized and patent owners should be persuaded to relax patent norms in the view of crisis.
- On condition that, Vaccines would be strictly be used for domestic use and cannot be exported without the approval of patent holders.
- This would help ensure that universal vaccination against the virus is completed at the earliest.
