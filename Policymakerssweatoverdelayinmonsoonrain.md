# Policy makers sweat over delay in monsoon rain
- Due to the weak progress of the southwest monsoon, sowing of Kharif crop has been lagging this year.
- India’s overarching dependence on rainfed irrigation means a poor monsoon can hit the economy and GDP growth. Mint explains the problem:

### What is the monsoon season for India?
- The southwest monsoon winds blow from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal to north India during June-September, while the northeast rains blow from northeast India to the southwest in October-November.
- The southwest monsoon usually reaches Kerala by 2 June, Mumbai by 9 June and Delhi by 29 June.
- Rainfall is normal when it is between 96% and 104% of thelong period average or LPA (averages of rainfall received overa 50-year period between 1951and 2001),
- deficient when it isless than 90%
- and ‘above normal’ when it is between 104% and 110% of the long period average.

### How crucial is the monsoon for India?
- Monsoons are the lifeblood of Indian farming.
- As much as 51.2% of farms in the country are rainfed, while the irrigated area accounts for 48.8%.
- The southwest monsoon is crucial for the cultivation of Kharif crops and early rainfall is critical for the planting of cotton, pulses, rice and oilseeds such as soyabean.
- Monsoons have a close linkage with India’s agricultural production.
- With around 50% of our total food output being summer crops, a delayed monsoon can hit the supply of foodgrains and other farm products such as vegetables and fruits and even impact food inflation.

### What does it mean for the Indian economy?
- Agriculture’s share in India’s GDP was 19.9% in FY21.
- The agriculture and allied products export market was $41.25 billion.
- Agriculture’s share in wholesale and consumer price indices is 13.98% and 32.96%, respectively.
- Thus, supply shortages of farm produce could lead to higher inflation.
- Agro-based industries like sugar and cotton are affected by monsoons.
- With the rural economy insulating the overall economy during many crisis situations, FMCG, fertilizers, seeds and tractors depend on the agri performance for demand.

### Why are policymakers interested in rain data?
- With monsoons contributing 89 cm out of 116cm of rain every year, changes in arrival and intensity are monitored by policymakers.
- The Centre devises policy measures for food safety, including imports, price stability and buffer stock, and financial assistance, i.e. farm credit, insurance cover, etc.
- The RBI works out monetary policy factoring in expected inflationary pressures and credit policy.
- India Inc’s marketing plans rely on the impact of rains on rural income.


### What is the current year’s trend of the monsoon?
- The overall rainfall for June was above normal (9.6% above the LPA);
- however, it turned deficient from 21 June (30.2% below the LPA).
- As of 25 June, only 20.3 million hectares had been sown under Kharif crops, as against 25.9 million hectares in June 2020.
- As of 16 July, with 57% of the total Kharif area being sown, it was still 11.56% lower than July 2020.
