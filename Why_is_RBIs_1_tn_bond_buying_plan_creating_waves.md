# Why is RBI’s ₹1 tn bond  buying  plan creating waves?
- The central bank on 7 April announced a ₹1 trillion government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP) 1.0,
- as the Monetary Policy Committee presses ahead with its accommodative policy stance.
- Mint explains the bond plan and its impact on bonds and the rupee.

### What is G-SAP 1.0 programme?
- G-SAP 1.0 is a programme under which the central bank will purchase government bonds worth ₹1 trillion from the secondary market in the first quarter of 2021-22.
- This is a variant of the quantitative easing programmes adopted by many advanced economies.
- Government borrowing plans announced in Union Budget 2021-22 had led to a sharp rise in bond yields.
- The well-structured G-SAP is expected to calm investor nerves, and quell volatility in long-term bond yields.
- This unconventional monetary policy tool aims to further build a financial scenario conducive for faster economic recovery.

### How’s it different from other  borrowing  plans?
- G-SAP 1.0 will be conducted alongside other operations such as liquidity adjustment facility, outright open-market operations and Operation Twist.
- In FY21, the RBI had purchased bonds worth ₹3.13 trillion in an ad hoc manner.
- It has now clearly spelt out the amount for the purchase of these bonds, enabling investors to plan better for auctions.
- This is expected to reduce volatility in bond prices and enable a methodical development of the yield curve.
- With this, the RBI has also drawn the path for its commitment of an expansion in its balance sheet of a specified amount.

### What was the immediate impact?
- While the bond markets cheered the announcement with the 10-year bond yield falling to 6.08% and 6.03% on 7 and 8 April,respectively,
- the rupee depreciated to ₹74.587 on 8 April.
- The depreciation was an outcome of the narrowing of returns on investment between India and the US. US bond yields have been rising in the recent past,
- thereby narrowing the spread between US and Indian 10-year bond yields,
- resulting in an outflow of foreign capital, leading to the depreciation of the rupee.

### What is the likely impact on economy?
- It might drive away FIIs, resulting in depreciation of the rupee.
- This in turn, may have an adverse effect on current account deficit and lead to imported inflation.
- The positive side is the infusion of additional money into the system without disturbing bond holdings of commercial banks under the SLR norms, as the latter are by-passed.
- Possibly, upward pressure on interest rates may get softened at a time when the Centre is coming out with a large borrowing plan.


### How does the RBI plan to execute the programme?
- The first purchase of ₹25,000 crore under the multiple price method on 15 April resulted in bond yields rising to 6.12%.
- Keeping in mind that the RBI is the debt manager of the Centre and slated to borrow nearly ₹12.06 trillion in FY22 in a non-disruptive manner,
- G-SAP 1.0 is expected to give the much-needed comfort to the bond market.
