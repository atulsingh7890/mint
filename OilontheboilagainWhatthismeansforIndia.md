# Oil on the boil again: What this means for India
- With Goldman Sachs projecting crude oil to reach $90 per barrel by the year-end,
- energy import-dependent economies are now in a tizzy.
- Mint looks at the implications for India, which imports 85% of its oil and 53% of its gas requirements.

### How will the price rise impact India?
- The recent surge in crude oil prices prompted both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
- and federal think tank NITI Aayog to flag the need for the Centre and states to contain input cost pressures on businesses.
- A further surge could put pressure to cut taxes, which may impact revenues and spending.
- Government spending had already seen moderation in the June quarter from the year ago period.
- RBI has forecast the economy to grow at 9.5% in FY22,
- comprising 21.4% expansion in the June quarter and 7.3% in the September quarter followed by 6.3% in the December quarter and 6.1% in the March quarter.

### Should consumers be worried?
- Oil prices have witnessed sharp volatility in the past.
- The price of India’s basket of crude oil that represents the average of Oman, Dubai, and Brent plunged to $19.90 in April last year during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
- That gave the Central government an opportunity to raise taxes on petrol and diesel steeply,
- making excise duty one of the major contributors to the exchequer in FY21.
- However, global oil prices have now recovered and unless taxes are cut, any rise in oil prices will further pinch consumers.
- The price was $76.89 a barrel on 27 September.

### What does India pay to keep engine running?
- India spent $62.71 billion on crude oil imports in FY21,
- $101.4 billion in FY20
- and $111.9 billion in FY19.
- It is a key refining hub in Asia, with an installed capacity of over 249.36 million tonnes per annum (mtpa).
- India has been calling for a global consensus on “responsible pricing” as it plans to grow its refining capacity to 400 mtpa by 2025.
- Diesel and petrol prices in India have already breached the ₹100 mark and are at a record high.
- Domestic diesel demand is expected to reach pre-covid-19 levels by Diwali.

### What is the domestic outlook?
- India is looking at private investment to raise domestic oil and gas production, which has stagnated for the last few years.
- Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015 had set a target of reducing India’s oil dependence by 10% to 67% (based on import dependence of 77% in FY15) by 2022.
- There has been an uptick in India’s gas production.
- According to the monthly production report released by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas,
- there was a 20.23% increase in gas production in August.

### What’s happening with crude prices?
- Crude rallied in the backdrop of hurricane Ida impacting US Gulf Coast production and a fall in US inventories.
- This comes at a time when global oil demand is rising.
- But industry sees oil prices softening next year.
- “Prices may come down in 2022, maybe to $65-$70 a barrel (on average),” S&P Global Platts said,
- quoting D.V. Mamadapur, exe-cutive director, international trade, BPCL.
