# Why retail loans continue to grow amid a slowdown
- India is in the midst of a consumption slowdown,
- which translates into an economic slowdown given that private consumption expenditure forms around three-fifths of the country’s economy.
- Curiously, retail loans of banks continue to grow robustly.
- Mint probes this dichotomy.


### How fast have retail loans of banks been growing?
- The year-on-year (y-o-y) growth of retail loans of banks over the last two years has been in the range of 15-20%.
- In June 2019, the y-o-y growth in retail loans was a strong 16.6%.
- Retail loans primarily comprise home loans, vehicle loans, credit card outstanding, education loans and personal loans.
- The non-food credit growth in June slowed down to 11.1% in comparison to 13.1% at the beginning of the year.
- Hence, the continued robust growth of bank retail loans is surprising considering that there is enough evidence that consumption is slowing down.


### Why are retail loans still growing at a strong pace?
- The disbursal of housing loans by banks continues to grow at a fast pace.
- In June, the y-o-y growth of housing loans was at 18.9%.
- Housing loan growth has picked up more since the beginning of this year.
- This leads to an interesting dichotomy.
- For the last few months we have seen a fall in the sales of cars, motorcycles and scooters.
- Even mopeds are not selling, with their sales falling by 21.8% in June.
- Hence, what is puzzling in the prevailing economic environment is that if people are going slow on buying mopeds,
- how are they still willing to buy homes?


### What proportion of retail loans is housing loans?
- In July 2017, housing loans accounted for 51.8% of retail loans.
- In June 2019, they formed 52.7% of retail loans.
- This jump has led to the continued robustness in retail loan growth.


### Which are the fastest growing loans under retail?
- Credit card outstanding continues to grow at a fast pace.
- In June 2019, this segment grew by 27.6%.
- In 2018, it had constantly grown at higher than 30%.
- Personal loans in June 2019 grew by 23.2%.
- In late 2017 and early 2018, the segment had grown at higher than 40%.
- Therefore, the unsecured portion of retail loans is growing at the fastest pace.
- Hopefully, banks haven’t lowered their lending standards to ensure that these loan segments continue to grow at a fast pace.


### What about vehicle loans?
- In June, vehicle loans grew 5.1% year-on-year, down from 8.6% in January.
- Thus, the growth pace has dropped since the start of the year.
- Growth in this segment has been slow, but this comes despite vehicle sales falling across the spectrum.
- What then is the reason for the growth in vehicle loans?
- A possible explanation lies in the fact that people are trading down and buying second-hand vehicles, especially cars, and taking loans to finance those.
