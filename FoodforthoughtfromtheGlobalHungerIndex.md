# Food for thought from the Global Hunger Index
- India has slid down the Global Hunger Index (GHI) this year,
- falling behind its South Asian neighbours to rank 101 out of 116 countries.
- The government has dismissed the report’s “unscientific” methodology. Mint explains the numbers:

### What’s the controversy surrounding GHI?
- The hunger index ranks countries on four indicators: 
- the share of undernourished population,
- stunting and wasting among children,
- and child mortality.
- India’s overall score has improved since 2012, the last year the data is comparable with, but its rank has dropped.
- India’s rank dropped due to poorer scores on under-5 wasting (from 15.1% in 2012 to 17.3% now)
- and undernourished Indians (from 15% to 15.3%).
- The government says the undernourishment score is based on a “four-question” telephonic opinion poll conducted by Gallup, and does not reflect the ground reality.
- But the report’s publishers deny this.

### Is undernourishment score based on a poll?
- That particular number in the GHI is based on a 2021 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report.
- Indeed, some FAO data relies on Gallup polls, but undernourishment isn’t one of them.
- This data is based on several indicators,
- one being the FAO’s “food balance sheets” that estimate the share of population with inadequate access to calories.
- The government is peeved that the scores do not reflect the welfare work done during the pandemic.
- But the GHI undernourishment figure reflects the yearly average for 2018-20,
- and stunting and wasting figures are for 2016-20.

### How should one interpret the GHI?
- The GHI, like any other index, has its flaws.
- But it is a peer-reviewed report and has undergone methodological improvements over the years.
- It is internationally recognized and can be used for a broader understanding of a country’s performance on hunger.
- The findings are based on data reported by the countries and multilateral organizations.
- The Centre may dislike the report, but its own family health survey of 2019-20 doesn’t paint a rosy picture.
- The GHI can help identify problems that may need policy intervention.

### What has been the Centre’s reaction?
- The government tends to question international reports that show slippage on socio-economic-political metrics but celebrates the ones that show an improvement.
- It promoted the now-discredited World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index when it was doing well.
- But the World Press Freedom Index and the Democracy Index, which showed India sliding, came under close scrutiny.
- It has also been dismissive of unfavourable media reports,
- such as The Economist’s claim that India’s official covid toll was a gross undercount.

### Are there any limitations with the index?
- Yes. First, FAO’s undernourishment data uses a uniform calorie benchmark, which experts say has its own problems.
- Second, the scores are not comparable across years, so there’s no way of knowing whether India did better or worse in 2021.
- Third, it will be years before we know India’s true score for 2021 to compare with other countries.
