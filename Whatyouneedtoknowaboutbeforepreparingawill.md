# What you need to know about preparing a Will ?
- Covid-19 has brought home the risk of mortality, especially at an early age.
- The suffering for the surviving members following the death of the head of the family can get aggravated due to legal disputes.
- During these uncertain times, Mint explains why making a Will is important.

### Why is it important to prepare a Will ?
- If a person dies intestate (without a will), the law of succession (Hindu, Shariah, etc.) comes into effect.
- This not only increases the scope for legal disputes, but also increases the processing time for inheritance.
- So if you want to bequeath some assets to your spouse, some others in different proportions among your children or make provision for your parents, a properly executed will with clear instructions helps make a smooth transition.
- Note that nominations are not the answer, as a nominee is just the custodian of an asset, and may not be the legal heir. A Will supersedes nomination.


### How to go about creating a Will?
- You can avail the services of a lawyer or prepare a Will online.
- Many banks, as well as other financial institutions, such as brokers, have tie-ups with legal firms to help prepare a Will online, offering both basic templates or customised content.
- The process is simple and convenient—register on the website and provide the details of your assets and how you would like those to be distributed.
- Once you submit the details, the service provider sends you a soft copy of the draft of the Will.
- Once you confirm, the final Will is mailed to you.
- Such portals also offer services such as registration of the Will and appointing an executor.


### How can you minimise succession disputes ?
- In order to minimize disputes,one should register the Will before a sub-registrar.
- Two witnesses and a doctor’s certificate stating that the person executing the Will is of sound mental health are required at the time of registration.
- It is advised to shoot a video after making the Will.
- Also, if you want to exclude a family member, you should mention his or her name and clearly state that you are not leaving behind any asset for the person.
- Also, it is always advisable to appoint an executor.

### Registration charges and tax liability
- Though registration is not mandatory, it is advised to get the Will registered.
- The registration charges vary from state to state and may go up to ₹1,000.
- If you have inherited a property through a Will, there is no tax on it.
- So in case a son receives a property through a Will (whether registered or not), there will be no tax liability on him.
- Also, in case a person other than the legal heir gets a property through a Will, there is no tax liability.
- Any property inherited through a Will is exempted from tax.

### What should not be part of your Will?
- Any asset that you own can be included in a Will.
- But, it is always better to ensure that the title of the property is clear before you include it.
- For example, ancestral proper-ties (part of an HUF) can’t be part of your Will.
- Any inherited property where the inheritance is not complete can’t be part of your Will.
- So you can’t include a property which you are likely to inherit.
