# What the rise in foodgrain output means for India
- With the farm sector seeing a growth of 4.5% in the first quarter of FY22
- and a record foodgrain production of 150.5 million tonnes (mt) during the kharif season,
- the hard work of farmers, proficiency of scientists, and near normal monsoons have given positive returns.

### How important is foodgrain production?
- Agriculture and its allied activities in FY21 contributed 20.2% to the GVA of India.
- Foodgrain production being the primary livelihood source for nearly 55% of the population
- also contributes to the supply base of agri-based industries such as cotton, sugar, vegetable oil, tea etc.
- It provides market support to agri-dependent industries like fertilizers, tractors etc.
- India is amongst the 15 leading exporters of agricultural products worldwide.
- The agricultural sector helps provide employment, leads to mitigation of poverty and reducing inequalities by providing income generation and means of livelihood.

### How has the kharif output been this time?
- The Indian farm sector exhibited a robust growth of 3.4% in FY21 and 4.5% in Q1FY22,
- and the exports of farm and allied products saw an increase of 21.8% in April-August.
- With a target of 307.3 mt of foodgrain production for FY22, the first advance estimates of the production of major kharif crops for FY22 show a record foodgrain production of 150.5 mt, 7.8 mt higher than the average foodgrain production of the past five years (FY17-FY21).
- Production of kharif rice in FY22 has been 9.21 mt higher than previous five years.
- Rice exports recorded a growth of 13.7%, while processed food products saw a growth of 41.9% in April-August.

### What do the latest estimates signal?
- A resurgent rural economy will help insulate the Indian economy and drive the country back onto the economic recovery track.
- Improving rural prospects will stimulate consumer demand for FMCG products, light motor vehicles, telecom products etc.
- Increased income in the hands of the rural population will lead to higher consumption resulting in increased production levels and higher capacity utilization.
- In terms of inflation, rising foodgrain production will help bring down consumer price inflation.

### Can rural economy consolidation happen?
- Consolidation of rural economy can be achieved through structural reforms, especially without dithering over the implementation of farm reform laws.
- The strengthening of rural supply chains such as cold chains and refrigerated transportation,
- building of warehousing facilities, promoting of agro-based industries such as food processing industries, etc.
- will help build momentum, leading to increased investments and production.


### What are the key reasons for the rise in production?
- A close to normal monsoon, irrigation, aggressive implementation of MGNREGA, crop insurance availability, uninterrupted supply of fertilizers and efficient sowing activities are some of the key reasons.
- While June-August had a (-9.22%) departure from normal rainfall, the prediction is that September will be above 110% of the long-period average of 170mm.
