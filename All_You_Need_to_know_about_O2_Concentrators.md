- Oxygen Therapy has become one of the primary modes of treatment.
- Following is an assessment how Oxygen Concentrators are helpful in covid-19 treatment.

### What is an oxygen concentrator?
- medical device that draws in ambient air, passes it through a molecular sieve to concentrate room oxygen to therapeutic levels.
- provides supplemental or extra oxygen.
- can supply a continuous stream of oxygen at flow rates of up to 10 litres per minute.
-  “The core of an oxygen concentrator is what you call a sieve bed. This separates the oxygen from the air and passes it on to the patient at 95% purity,” said Rajiv Mohan, owner, Shakti Technology Enterprises, a New Delhi-based firm that has been dealing in respiratory care equipment.

### How do capacity and purity come into play?
- Two most common models outputs 5 litres and 10 litres of oxygen. 
- Some brands offer 8 litres per minute
- How much Oxygeen a patient is able to extract is more important that capacity/purity.
- How much Oxygen is getting into the blood is important.

### How helpful are they for covid-19 patients?
- Were designed for chronic respiratory illness not acute situations like covid-19.

### What to look for when buying a concentrator?
- You should be getting at least 92-95% purity from these machines at 5 litres per minute.
- Any machine that offers 50% oxygen purity is not fit for use.
- Noise levels less than 50 and portability are also key factors.

### What makes them different from oxygen cylinders?
- Cylinders can only store a fixed amount of oxygen, but concentrators capture and filter the air around you.
- The limitation is they need continuous power supply.
- Concentrators are selling at a premium.
