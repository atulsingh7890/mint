# What Air India’s sale means for the country
- The ongoing privatization of Air India will reduce the government’s borrowing burden,
- and revive confidence in the country’s reforms agenda.
- Mint explains the privatization of the national carrier, and its implications for the Indian economy.

### Why did the Centre sell Air India?
- Air India, whose condition deteriorated in the decades since it was nationalized in 1953, is returning to the Tata group which founded it.
- The government decided to privatize it not only because it was burdened with massive debt,
- but also due to the changed policy approach.
- Over the last three decades, successive Indian governments have shifted from playing a pro-active role in economic development to being a facilitator.
- The current central government believes it has no business to be in non-strategic areas.
- The airline sector happens to be an example of one such non-strategic area.

### But why did it sell the family silver?
- Air India had become a major liability draining away tax-payers’ money, which could otherwise have been utilised for many welfare schemes targeted at the poor.
- One can see that the airline’s mountain of debt had only been piling up and worsening every year rather than improving.
- At the end of August this year, it had a colossal debt of ₹61,652 crore.
- Talace Pvt. Ltd, a unit of Tata Sons Ltd, will assume ₹15,300 crore of debt, with the balance ₹46,262 crore taken over by the government’s Air India Asset Holding Ltd.
- The Tatas will also pay ₹2,700 crore in cash to the government.

### What does the deal mean for investors?
- In short, a decisive step forward.
- Air India was listed for disinvestment over 20 years ago, and its sale now highlights the government’s commitment to economic reforms.
- This may send a positive signal to domestic and foreign investors, boosting the upcoming divestment of a couple of Navratnas.
- This may also brighten the country’s economic environment, at a time when the macroeconomic indicators are looking up thanks to greater mobility and rising vaccinations.

### What’s the likely effect on capital markets?
- Being a strategic sale, there might not be any direct effect in terms of access to investable shares.
- But the diminished burden on the exchequer and reduced borrowing pressure on the government are expected to influence foreign portfolio investors’ outlook of India.
- It may deliver encouraging results in terms of overall capital markets, strengthen the rupee and reduce the current account deficit.
- The sale has boosted overall sentiments in the Indian capital markets.

### What is the significance of Tatas winning the bid?
- The Tatas merely happened to be the successful bidder in a transparent disinvestment process using internationally accepted norms.
- However, it assumes special significance since it was founded by J.R.D Tata.
- The Tata group is reputed for its professional approach, and has recent experience operating Vistara and AirAsia.
