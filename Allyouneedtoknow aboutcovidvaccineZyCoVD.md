# All you need to know  about  covid vaccine ZyCoV-D
- Ahmadabad-based drugmaker Zydus Cadila has applied for an emergency-use authorization for its three-dose covid-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D.
- With a “primary efficacy” of 66.6%, the jab, if approved, will be the world’s first DNA vaccine. Mint explains:

### What kind of vaccine is ZyCoV-D?
- ZyCoV-D is a three-dose, plasmid DNA vaccine that produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2
- and elicits an immune response mediated by the cellular (T lymphocytes immunity) and humoral (antibody-mediated immunity) arms of the human immune system.
- It is also an intradermal vaccine, applied using a ‘needle-free injector’.
- Zydus claims the needle-free system can lead to a significant reduction in side effects.
- The vaccine uses a ‘plug and play’ technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based.
- It also means that a new form of the vaccine can be rapidly generated against any variant.

### What is a plasmid DNA vaccine?
- Plasmids are DNA molecules that replicate independently from the host’s chromosomal DNA.
- They are mainly found in bacteria.
- A plasmid DNA vaccine involves injecting into the appropriate tissues a plasmid containing the DNA sequence encoding of the antigen against which an immune response is sought, and relies on the in-situ (original) production of the target antigen.
- This approach offers a number of potential advantages over traditional approaches,
- including the stimulation of both B- and T-cell responses,
- improved vaccine stability, the absence of any infectious agent and the relative ease of large-scale production.

### What is ZyCoV-D’s efficacy against covid?
- Zydus claimed to have conducted the largest clinical trial for a covid-19 vaccine in India in over 50 centres.
- This was also the first time that any covid-19 vaccine had been tested in the 12-18-year age group in the country.
- Around 1,000 subjects were enrolled in this age group and the vaccine was found to be safe.
- The tolerability profile was similar to that seen in the adult population.
- Primary efficacy of 66.6% has been attained for symptomatic RT-PCR positive cases in an “interim analysis”.

### How many doses can Zydus produce?
- Zydus Cadila has said it plans to manufacture 100-120 million doses of ZyCoV-D annually.
- Zydus will also be partnering with contract manufacturing organizations where it could potentially transfer its technology to produce another 50-70 million doses of the vaccine.
- The pharma company will be manufacturing the vaccine at its plant at the Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
- It has invested ₹400-500 crore on clinical trials and scaling up manufacturing capacity.

### What are the storage requirements for ZyCoV-D?
- ZyCoV-D is stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius, but it has shown good stability at temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius for at least three months.
- The company said the thermostability of the vaccine will help in easy transportation and storage and reduce any cold chain breakdown challenges.
- The vaccine is easy to manufacture with minimal biosafety requirements (BSL-1).
