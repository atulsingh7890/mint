# Corona variants have markets on tenterhooks
- The rising number of coronavirus variants is haunting global asset classes.
- Markets—from crude to cryptocurrencies and equities—have corrected sharply in the past five trading sessions.
- Crude has fallen over 10% and Indian equity indices about 2% in the last two sessions.

### Why did global markets fall?
- A resurgence in covid-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, is said to be making investors nervous.
- In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its steepest drop in nine months on Monday.
- Consequently, the fear-gauge, Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked to a two-month high.
- While there is still ample liquidity in the system, rising covid caseloads have fuelled doubts about the pace of global recovery and inflation.
- Covid-led growth concerns soured sentiment across asset classes including crude and emerging market currencies, with bond yields also softening.

### Which sectors, stocks were the casualties?
- Travel, tourism and hospitality remain the worst-hit.
- Concerns about re-introduction of lockdowns sent shares of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (Indigo) down 5% on Tuesday.
- Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), Indian Hotels Company Ltd, and Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd stocks were also under pressure.
- While most sectoral indices ended the day’s session in the red, the Nifty Metals index declined nearly 2.5%.
- Investors booked profits in metal stocks after the price of copper, an indicator of the health of the global economy, slid to a one-month low.

### What is the outlook on liquidity?
- Central banks are yet to reverse their loose monetary policy stance.
- In June, the US Federal Reserve left the key interest rate unchanged, but its forecasts now signal a hike in 2023, a year earlier than previously expected.
- The Fed said in June it has started talks about scaling back bond purchases.
- Since the US Fed is trend-setter, an earlier-than-anticipated unwinding of quantitative easing programmes would be a dampener for equities.
- The Jackson Hole meeting scheduled in August would be closely watched for further clarity.

### How severe is the correction?
- Not very: it’s a mere 2-4% from the peak.
- But, driven by abundant liquidity, Nifty 500 and S&P 500 are 33% and 26% above their pre-covid highs.
- This means that global equity investors have taken the pandemic in their stride.
- That said, lofty valuation of Indian stocks is making analysts wary.
- Analysts caution against froth, especially in Indian midcaps and smallcaps, which have seen a massive rally with hardly any fundamental factors backing them.
- So, analysts say, the market was ripe for some correction.

### How is the earnings season panning out?
- The June quarter earnings in the US have been decent, lending some support to equities.
- A widely held expectation is that India companies’ earnings are bound to look good aided by the low base of last year.
- But so far, it has been a mixed bag.
- Investors need to watch out for a rise in bad loans and delinquencies, especially after HDFC Bank’s weak Q1 earnings.
