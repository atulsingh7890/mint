# How rising global commodity prices hurt the economy
- With the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) scaling to a new high of 12.94% and Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based retail inflation touching a six-month-high of 6.3% in May 2021,
- the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has termed rising commodity prices as a high systemic risk. Mint explains:

### Why is commodity price rise a concern?
- With the economy charting a course toward recovery following the devastating second wave of covid-19 cases, its susceptibility to external shocks and the fear of a third wave is a matter of concern.
- In such a scenario, rising international commodity prices have been termed as high systemic risk by RBI in its Financial Stability Report of July 2021.
- Prices of steel, crude oil, iron ore, copper, aluminium etc., have risen in the domestic and international markets.
- The central bank wants to be cautious and monitor if the impact of rising WPI is being extended to CPI and act accordingly.

### How can imported inflation impact India?
- Spiralling global commodity prices of crude oil and base metals are bound to intensify inflation in countries importing such commodities.
- This could be due to increased imported commodities cost as well as depreciation of home currency resulting in higher import prices.
- Crude, petroleum products, coal coke and briquettes etc., form a large part of Indian imports (about. 21.6%, 5.8%, 4.7%, respectively).
- With India importing 82.8% of its crude oil requirements, high oil prices adversely impact inflation.
- Moreover, unlocking of the economy has resulted in increased demand for commodities such as steel, iron ore, etc.

### What is alarming about the present trend?
- These crucial raw materials have widespread effects on cost of production.
- In terms of WPI, their combined contribution is 22.97%.
- Moreover, steel and aluminium are directly associated with construction which has just started showing revival.
- Rising costs could deter homebuyers and other construction activities, dealing a blow to the employment genera-ting sector.
- Also, with India reeling under the shock of high fuel prices, the impasse among Opec+ countries over increasing oil production worsens the situation.

### Should India ramp up policy support?
- Basically commodity prices are rising because countries are on the economic recovery path resulting in increasing demand;
- global trade is improving; and ample liquidity is now available in the global financial markets.
- This has resulted in inflation levels increasing worldwide.
- However, the increase is being seen as transitory:
- the expectation is that it will revert to its long-term average of below 5% in emerging economies.



### Does depreciation of the rupee matter?
- Depreciation in the external value of the rupee worsens the situation as the landed cost of imported commodities rises more than the actual increase in prices in the international markets.
- Depreciation of the rupee may take place purely on account of external factors such as net outflow of foreign institutional investment or a tense global business environment.
