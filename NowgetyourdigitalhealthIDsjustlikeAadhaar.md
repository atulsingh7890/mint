# Now, get your digital health IDs, just like Aadhaar
- Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission,
- which aims to provide digital health IDs for all Indian citizens to help hospitals, insurance firms, and citizens access health records electronically when required.
- Mint explores:

### What are digital health IDs?
- It is a unique 14-digit health identification number to be created using a person’s mobile number or Aadhaar.
- The digital health ID will allow users, hospitals and companies to access health records digitally.
- For example, presenting this ID to a healthcare provider will allow people to digitally receive lab reports, prescriptions, and diagnoses from verified doctors and health service providers.
- According to the government, the analysis of health data will lead to better planning, budgeting and implementation for states and health programmes, helping save costs and improve treatment.

### What information will Health IDs capture?
- Healh IDs will have all health-related information of a person, but the sharing of the records will be done with the consent of citizens.
- This data will contain details of laboratory tests, medical history, doctor visits, prescriptions, and diagnosis.
- Health workers and hospitals will be able to access the information for proper treatment even if the patient moves to a new city or visits a new doctor.
- The government claims that citizens will be able to manage their health records and others for whom they are authorized in a private, secure, and confidential environment.

### Are there any privacy concerns?
- Experts have warned that the government will have to be careful with the implementation of the programme.
- While the most of them agree that the health IDs are a noble step, the lack of a data protection bill could lead to the misuse of data by private firms and bad actors.
- Also, interoperability between systems built by different states and the central repository will be important to ensure that the system works as needed.
- Some also worry about citizens being excluded and denied healthcare due to faults in the system.

### What are the other features  of  the mission?
- The other major component of the programme is creating a healthcare professionals’ registry (HPR) and healthcare facilities registry (HFR),
- allowing easy electronic access to medical professionals and health infrastructure.
- The HPR will be a comprehensive repository of all healthcare professionals involved in delivering healthcare services across both modern and traditional systems of medicine.
- The HFR database will have records of all the country’s health facilities.

### Is the new Health ID mandatory for citizens?
- The Health ID will be free of cost and voluntary.
- However, the government insists that the medical records of private citizens will be stored to ensure security, confidentiality, and privacy of health-related information.
- If insurance firms, hospitals etc. demand health IDs in the future, it will become mandatory, even if the same is not required by law.
