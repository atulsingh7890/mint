# How a secondary loan market will benefit lenders
- In the first step towards building a secondary loan market in India,
- 10 banks including State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank came together last week to set up the Secondary Loan Market Association (SLMA),
- where lenders will trade corporate loans.
- Mint explains how it will work.

### How will the SLMA operate?
- The SLMA has been set up as a self-regulatory body following the recommendation of a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) task force on developing the secondary loan market.
- Apart from SBI and ICICI Bank, it includes Canara Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Deutsche Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank.
- It will build an online system for the standardization and simplification of primary loan documentation, and standardization of the purchase and sale/assignment documentation and other trading mechanisms for the secondary loan market.

### How will it benefit lenders?
- The SLMA will help banks manage loan portfolios to comply with regulatory capital requirements.
- Banks can sell specific loans which could open up more lending opportunities.
- It also helps banks manage asset-liability mismatches, adhere to RBI’s large exposure framework and trim concentration risk.
- It also provides opportunities for small banks to participate in highly creditworthy lending exposures at the time of origination.
- In case of potentially stressed borrowers, the secondary market helps banks reduce the overall recovery cost as the lenders can go for an immediate realization of value even before a default.

### How will it benefit companies?
- The secondary market helps larger borrowers widen their lender base, avoiding funding uncertainties associated with having banking relationships with a few lenders.
- It also helps them gain better access to market participants with different risk appetites by multiple trenching of loans.
- The secondary market for corporate loans also helps the borrower by enabling a single point of contact for their borrowing needs and provides a mechanism to retire the existing loans and avail of funds/debt at a lower cost.

### What about secondary loan markets abroad?
- According to the RBI task force report, the annual secondary loan trade volumes in the US was as high as $720 billion in 2018.
- In terms of traded asset classes, the market in the US can be segregated into leveraged loans constituting 46%,
- investment grade loans constituting 38%, and middle market loans constituting the remaining 16% of the traded loans.
- India follows the model of the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association, which had traded volumes of $71.2 billion in the first quarter of 2019.

### What is the current size of this market?
- Bloomberg data shows that the volume of rupee syndicated loans stood at ₹0.94 trillion till July 2021, ₹2.18 trillion in 2020, and ₹1.68 trillion in 2019, which is expected to go up with the debut of the SLMA.
- RBI data shows 96,303 borrowers have an aggregate credit exposure of ₹5 crore and above, with 266 of them having an aggregate exposure of ₹5,000 crore or above.
