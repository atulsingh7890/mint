# Long and short  of the  much-awaited Tokyo Olympics
- The Tokyo Olympics, which have been delayed by more than a year because of the covid-19 pandemic,
- finally begin today under a strict covid protocol that includes a ban on spectators.
- Mint takes a look at what is at stake:

### What’s different about the Tokyo Olympics?
- Even though the Tokyo Games are taking place in the summer of 2021, they are still referred to as the 2020 Olympics.
- Covid-19 protocols will be in place and a slew of new events, such as karate, skateboarding, and surfing, will be part of the Games.
- Baseball and softball will make their return to the Olympics after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
- There will be nine new mixed-gender events across seven sports.
- In total, there will be a record 41 sports.
- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said women’s participation in Tokyo will be 49%, up from 45% at Rio, a nearly even split with the men.

### Why wasn’t the event cancelled this year?
- Public sentiment in Japan has been opposed to holding the Games because of fears that it will lead to a spike in cases in the country.
- The second-largest selling newspaper in Japan, the Asahi Shimbun, has called for the Olympics to be cancelled.
- However, there are billions of dollars at stake.
- Japan has officially spent $15.4 billion, but government audits suggest that the amount is twice that much.
- Also, the host city contract gives the IOC the sole authority to cancel the event.
- If Japan cancels, it would have to compensate the IOC.
- Estimates suggest a cancellation could cost the IOC $3-4 billion in lost broadcast rights income.

### How is India being represented?
- India is sending its largest ever contingent of 228 members, including 127 athletes.
- But athletes from seven sports, including shooting, badminton, archery, and hockey, will skip the opening ceremony because of covid fears, leaving about 30 in attendance.
- According to a 21 July report by The Times of India, Haryana and Punjab are leading the way for the country at the Games, with 31 and 19 participants, respectively.
- Tamil Nadu is sending 11 athletes, while Uttar Pradesh and Kerala are sending 5 athletes each.

### Who can get the medals for India?
- The hopes are of a first ever double -digit figure, surpassing the best haul of six achieved in 2012.
- The foremost among the contenders are 15 shooters, Mirabai Chanu in weightlifting, and the archery team led by world number one Deepika Kumari.
- The boxers are another set of big contenders with world number one Amit Panghal and six-time world champion M.C. Mary Kom in the ranks.
- In wrestling, Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat seem likely to win. P.V. Sindhu may win her second Olympic medal.


### Could the Games be cancelled mid-way?
- The head of the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee on 20 July did not rule out a last-minute cancellation of the global sporting showpiece.
- Toshiro Muto said he would keep an eye on the number of cases and hold discussions if necessary.
- Over 90 people, including athletes, accredited for the Tokyo Games have been tested positive for covid-19 so far.
