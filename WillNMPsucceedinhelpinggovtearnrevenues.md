# Will NMP succeed in helping govt earn revenues?
- The ₹6 trillion National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) unveiled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday has captured everybody’s attention.
- However, the Opposition has alleged that the government is trying to sell India’s crown jewels. Mint explains:

### Why is there a need to monetize assets?
- In a country like India, with massive infrastructure deficit, finding resources to build physical assets is a daunting task.
- Hence, the government wants to monetize existing infrastructure assets by leasing them out to private firms for a fixed tenure under a revenue sharing model.
- It will help the authorities ease fiscal constraints and free up balance sheets for more greenfield infrastructure creation.
- For example, a stadium built by the government that remains idle for most part of the year can be leased to a private party that can efficiently manage it by organizing cultural functions and allowing the public to use it for a fee.

### Is the pipeline a new concept?
- No. India has been monetizing assets for a long time through public-private partnerships (PPP).
- The Delhi airport has been built through the PPP mode.
- The concession period is 30 years after which it will either be renewed or transferred to the Airports Authority of India (AAI).
- The project that started in 2006 has been completed at a total cost of ₹12,500 crore, enabling world-class infrastructure creation with no additional cost to AAI.
- In 2020, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corp. Ltd awarded the tolling rights of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and old Mumbai-Pune corridor for ₹8,262 crore.

### Has this worked for other countries?
- Asset recycling has been enacted in Australia through the Asset Recycling Initiative (ARI) of the federal government, which during the 2014-15 budget announced the Infrastructure Growth Package (IGP), a 10-year vision of infra-structure investment in the nation.
- ARI was aimed at encouraging states to recycle assets and utilize the sale proceeds for productivity-enhancing infrastructure by asking private firms to fund and run public infrastructure.
- This helped unlock more than $17 billion in infrastruc-ture development across Australia.

### Is the ₹6 trillion target achievable in 4 years?
- Achieving ₹6 trillion through asset monetization in four years is a daunting task.
- This will need a coordinated effort and push from the top. A lot will also depend on market conditions.
- The Centre expects the global liquidity surplus to help it achieve the target.
- As these are de-risked infrastructure projects, it may be easier to monetize than sell Air India or Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd through strategic disinvestment.
- However, the government needs to avoid a situation where a few firms capture most of the assets.

### Will the money go directly to the government?
- Money from projects monetized by central government departments will go to the government.
- As most of the projects to be monetized are under various central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), the money accrued will be received by them.
- But the Centre often forces CPSEs to declare larger dividends so that this money can be trans-ferred to the Consolidated Fund of India.
