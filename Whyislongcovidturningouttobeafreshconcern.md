# Why is long covid turning out to be a fresh concern?
- People suffering from covid-19 are increasingly complaining of fatigue, fever, headaches and loss of smell for weeks, or even months, after the diagnosis.
- These people have also caught the attention of medical practitioners and support groups.
- Mint looks into the problem:

### What is long covid and how prevalent is it?
- Long covid refers to the phenomena where people continue to experience the effects of covid-19 for weeks or months.
- According to Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences,
    - if symptoms persist for 4-12 weeks, it should be regarded as post-covid acute syndrome,
    - while if symptoms persist for longer than 12 weeks, it should be marked as long covid.
- A study by Roberto Bernabei, Angelo Carfì, and Francesco Landi of 143 people hospitalized in Italy found that as much as 87.4% of the patients reported persistence of at least one symptom, with extreme fatigue being the most common.

### What are long covid’s symptoms?
- Two main groups of symptoms have been identified based on data shared by people on the Covid Symptom Study app.
- One group includes respiratory symptoms such as cough and difficulty in breathing, as well as fatigue and headaches.
- The other includes symptoms affecting various parts of the body, including the heart, gut, and brain.
- Palpitation, pins and needles, increased heart beats, and numbness, as well as ‘brain fog’ were also reported.
- A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which studied 3,171 non-hospitalized covid patients, showed 69% had one or more out-patient visits over the six months.

### What does this mean for India?
- There is no clear data about how many people have long covid in India, but we can get an idea from the UK, which saw a strong second wave as well.
- According to Office for National Statistics estimates, 1.1 million people reported long covid symptoms in the four weeks ending 6 March.
- More than two-thirds of them had symptoms for more than 12 weeks.
- India’s case-load in the second wave shows that the numbers for people with long covid could be much higher.
- This can put more stress on the already strained healthcare infrastructure.

### What should be done to help patients?
- Recovery from covid-19 is counted as those who have not died from the virus.
- However, experts believe monitoring the health of those who have recovered for up to a year is required to make sure they are really out of danger.
- Guleria has suggested rehabilitation of patients experiencing long covid and setting up of multidisciplinary post-covid clinics.
- Experts believe that for long covid survivors a multidisciplinary and multi-care approach would be needed because it can impact so many different organs.

### Can long covid impact survivors mentally?
- Anxiety and depression have been seen as fallouts of long covid, with survivors suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD)
-  A study published in The Lancet Psychiatry at the beginning of this year suggested that adults suffering from long covid are more likely to be diagnosed with psychiatric conditions.
