# How should you insure yourself amid covid-19?
- As the second wave of the pandemic hits India, here is an insurance checklist.
- If you do not have health and life insurance, the pandemic is a good reminder to put some protection into place.
- If you already have such policies, you can increase the cover if it is inadequate.

### Will your health policies cover covid?
- The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) had asked all insurers to accept any claims concerning the treatment of covid-19.
- This simply means that your existing regular/comprehensive health insurance policy will cover covid-related medical expenses.
- However only hospitalisation will be covered and not outpatient treatment.
- Your policy may also have sub-limits like room rent caps.
- Several reports suggest that people with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular ailments or kidney disease are at greater risk of contracting coronavirus.

### Are there covid-specific policies?
- Yes. On the directions of Irdai, all health insurers came up with covid-specific health policies last year.
- The Covid-specific indemnity health policy or Corona Kavach covers hospitalisation expenses for the treatment on a positive diagnosis of covid-19.
- The max sum insured is ₹5 lakh.
- The covid-specific benefit-based health policy or Corona Rakshak offers a benefit equal to 100% sum insured, which will be payable on a positive diagnosis of covid.
- Max sum insured is ₹2.5 lakh. These policies were for periods of 3.5, 6.5 and 9.5 months. But, the window for buying such policies has been extended until 30 September 2021.

### How much coverage should you have?
- Covid treatment can prove quite expensive, particularly in advanced stages.
- If you are buying an individual health insurance policy, then you must have a cover of ₹5 lakh or more.
- If you are buying a family floater then you must ideally look for a cover of at least ₹10 lakh sum insured.
- This is what industry professionals typically suggest.
- You can also maximize the sum insured of your policy if you already have existing health insurance.
- You can buy a super top-up plan over and above your existing health policy.

### What about life insurance?
- If you have financial dependents, then life insurance is a must.
- Experts suggest term insurance which only pays out on death.
- The premiums on term insurance tend to be far lower than other types of insurance policies for a given level of sum assured.
- You can also add critical illness cover to your life insurance policy.
- The level of cover must be such that your future earnings would be replaced,
- but experts suggest cover that is 10 times your annual income.
- So if your annual income is ₹10 lakh, a cover of ₹1 crore can be looked at.

### Should you buy a family floater?
- If you have a family and you are looking for a cost-efficient option, you can buy a family floater health insurance.
- Family floater policies can be used to cover senior citizens, such as elderly parents.
- But, doing so will make the family floater plan a bit expensive as premiums are based on the age of the eldest member.
- Hence, you must buy individual health plans for them.
