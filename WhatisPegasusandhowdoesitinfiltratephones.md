## What is Pegasus and how does it infiltrate phones?
- First reported about in 2019, the Pegasus spyware is still one of the most chosen tools for **“total surveillance”**. 
- India’s name has figured among countries that used Pegasus to potentially target politicians, journalists, and activists.
- Here’s all you need to know about it:

### What is the Pegasus spyware?
- Simply put, Pegasus is a malware that is used to spy on people.
- Its creator, Israeli security firm NSO Group, has said it only sells the tool to government agencies, which has led to speculation about them being behind the recent hacks.
- A document containing the product details of Pegasus was uploaded to document cloud by Claudio Guarnieri, head of security lab at Amnesty International, in 2019.
- It said Pegasus was designed for three things:
  - collection of historic data on a device,
  - continuous monitoring of activity, and
  - transmission of this data to third parties.
- Security firm Kaspersky called it a tool for “total surveillance”.

### How does Pegasus infiltrate devices?
- Pegasus is part of a tier called “zero click exploits” that do not require the victim to do anything.
- Instead, the spyware is designed to take advantage of bugs in popular apps, such as iMessage and WhatsApp, to infiltrate the system.
- WhatsApp patched the vulnerability Pegasus exploited in 2019, but bugs in other apps have been the most common method of infiltration that his team has seen since 2019, Guarnieri said.
- It can also use unsecured websites to infiltrate a device.
- These are called network injection attacks and also happen without the victim’s intervention.
- The device is infiltrated within milliseconds of visiting such a website.

### Can anyone use Pegasus?
- The NSO Group claims that the tool is only sold to government agencies, though there has been speculation that it has been accessed by others.
- A New York Times report from 2016 said infiltrating 10 iPhones with Pegasus would cost more than a million dollars, which means that few hackers or hacking groups would have access to such a tool.
- However, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, which are usually backed by nation states or very large corporations, could gain such funding from their backers.

### Are there more spyware like Pegasus?
- Though Pegasus is NSO Group’s “flagship” product, it is not one of a kind.
- Milan-based Hacking Team also sells such tools to governments and corporations.
- Its RCSAndroid is a surveillance tool that used to be disguised as a news app on Google Play Store.
- The US National Security Agency’s Droupoutjeep is another such example, which was used to compromise iPhones.
- The Central Intelligence Agency once had a tool called Livestrong that was used to compromise devices running on Android 4.4 KitKat as was revealed by WikiLeaks.

### What is the protection against Pegasus?
- There’s nothing a victim can do once a device is infected, and Pegasus exploits previously unknown loopholes in apps, so devices can’t be protected by traditional means either.
- But best practices can be followed, like regularly updating apps, not visiting websites that don’t use the HTTPs protocol, and not clicking on unknown links or downloading unknown files.
