# Harvest season: a bright spot for the economy?
- The winter harvest season has turned out to be robust for farmers, despite a raging pandemic, because of better crop prices.
- As the larger economy struggles to contain covid-19 and its economic fallout, can higher farm incomes provide a cushion? 

### How has the harvest season been so far?
- The primary winter crops that are harvested from April to May are wheat, mustard, gram, and lentils.
- For all these crops, the wholesale prices are either around or more than the minimum support price (MSP) that have been announced by the government.
- Mandi prices for pulse varieties such as gram and lentils, for instance, are 2-5% above the MSP in major markets of Madhya Pradesh,
- while mustard prices have shot up to never-before-seen levels of ₹6,500 per quintal in Rajasthan,
- which is as much as 40% higher than support prices.
- Even a cereal like barley is trading at 10% higher than the MSP.

### What is the Centre’s procurement status?
- Wheat, the main winter harvest, is procured by the government to supply to the subsidised food security scheme.
- At present, the wholesale price of wheat is hovering around the MSP of ₹1,975 per quintal.
- In the ongoing harvest season, till Monday, the Centre purchased 12 million tonnes (mt) of wheat from farmers
- compared to 0.5 mt by this time last year when procurement was delayed due to the pandemic.
- Overall, the Centre has set a target to procure 43 mt of wheat, which is a staggering 40% of the total production in India.
- This is likely to support wheat prices further in the coming months.

### Will higher incomes push rural demand?
- Not all crop prices have followed the trend that has been seen in oilseeds, cereals, and pulses.
- Wholesale vegetable prices are 5% lower than those of last year, driven by a collapse in the price of potatoes.
- The spread of covid in rural areas could disrupt perishable supply chains and adversely impact farmer returns.
- Rural incomes could also take a hit because of migrant workers heading home and remittances dipping.
- In such a situation, higher incomes from non-perishable items can provide a cushion.

### What about retail inflation?
- Retail food inflation quickened to 4.9% in March compared to 3.9% in February.
- This is largely because of the higher prices of edible oil, animal protein, and pulses year-on-year.
- Retail food prices, particularly those of higher edible oil and pulses, could strain household budgets in the coming months.
- For instance, mustard oil is now retailing at ₹155 per litre in New Delhi, which is a sharp rise from last year’s price of ₹130 per litre.
- However, a further increase in retail food prices could prompt the Centre to lower import taxes.

### Why have farm harvest prices risen?
- Domestic prices are largely following global food price cues, which are at their highest levels since mid-2014.
- Import duties on edible oils and pulses have also supported farm-gate prices.
- The buoyancy in farm incomes could see further support if the annual south-west monsoon turns out to be normal as forecasted by the India Meteorological Department.
