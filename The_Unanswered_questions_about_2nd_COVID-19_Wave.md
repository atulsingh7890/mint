# The unanswered questions about 2nd covid-19 wave
The government on Monday said it has ordered 160 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin combined

### Why were early warnings ignored ?
- As per Reuters report, Government was warned by scientific advisers as early as March about a more contagious variant of Virus.
- Rakesh Mishra, director of the Center for Cellular & Molecular Biology, told The Wire on Tuesday(4 May 2021)
  - Heal Secretary Rajesh Bhushan was informed about it and its impossible to believe that the Prime Minister would not have been told.
- But, the Centre allowed the Kumb Mela and conducted election rallies in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam.


### What is the impact of the new variants ?
- On 24 April, National Centre for Disease Control director Sujeet Kumar Singh said mutant variants were becoming dominant.
- With the UK variant (B.1.1.7) becoming primary variant in Punjab, the Indian variant(B.1.617) become prominent in Maharashtra.
- Both variants are becoming dominant in Delhi.
- New strain first discovered in Andhra Pradesh, may be even more virulent than two prominent variants discovered in India.
  - First Discovered in West Bengal.

### Are tes kits able to detect these variants ?
- Although its claimed that kits are available to detect the new variants, but there is no data to substantiate that.
- As its being said that Mutations are happening in the spike protein gene and RT-PCR kits do not use spike protein gene. 
- Increase Number of False Negative is because of Human Errors as lab technicians are overworked.

### Will there by an audit of covid-19 deaths ?
- Increase in False Negatives and Delays in Testing
- Undercounting is happening due to that.
- Audit of situation is needed. 

### How is covid spreading in rural areas ?
- No updates on the spread on covid-19 in rural areas.
- Founding member of Jan Swashtya Sahyog, said most tests conducted in rural regions are antigen tests not the RT-PCR Tests.


### Should treatment protocols be updated ?
- ICMR has not informed the public about the change in tramissibility and mortality caused by mutant variants.
- There no known thing whether there will be change in treatment.
- AIMS Director Randeep Guleria has asked people not to overuse oxygen and drugs such as remdesivir.
- Government recommends use of Hydroxycholoroquine for mild covid-19 despite WHO's comments on its lack of benefits.

### Are vaccines effective against new variants ?
- Bharat Biotech shows Covaxin is effective against double mutant variant found in India and the UK variant.
- Similar thing is said for Covishield also.
- Covishield has been shown to be only 10% efficacious against the South African variant.

### How many deaths took place post vaccination ?
- The Centre has in over a month not provided details on the serious and severe adverse events following vaccination. 
- Only 13 final reports on serious adverse events are publicly available even as independent experts have tracked over hundreds of such cases. 
- These events are extremely rare, but the government’s clarity is needed, especially as vaccination has been opened for all adults and Covishield’s original version developed by AstraZeneca could be linked to rare cases of blood clots.


### What are the issues with oxygen supply ?
- There is an acute shortage of oxygen in India.
- The Centre said this is primarily because of inadequate facilities to transport oxygen from surplus states to deficit states.
- The shortage continues despite using ‘Oxygen Express’ trains and Air Force planes to fly back empty trucks.
- There is also a massive difference between the Centre and states over demand.
- A court hearing on 29 April showed Delhi had sought 700 metric tonnes of oxygen but received only 480-490 tonnes.


### What about vaccine procurement ?
- The government has adopted a piecemeal approach to buying vaccines, unlike countries such as the US and the UK, which have placed large advance orders with companies such as Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca.
- Many activists and journalists have regularly asked the Centre to reveal details of their deals, including pricing and quantities procured, but the Indian government has not been forthcoming with data on it, with a news report on Monday forcing it to reveal details to deny the report.
