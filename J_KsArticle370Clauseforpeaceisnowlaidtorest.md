# J&K’s Article 370: Clause for peace is now laid to rest
- The Centre has scrapped Article 370 of the Constitution that gave Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) special status.
- It also bifurcated the state into J&K and Ladakh, saying both will be treated as Union territories.
- Mint delves into the history of the state after the Centre’s radical move.


- The Narendra Modi government has added a landmark chapter to Jammu and Kashmir’s history,
- with the state no longer having its own Constitution or a separate flag.


### WHAT’S THE HISTORY OF J&K’S ACCESSION?
- Jammu and Kashmir was a princely state ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh when India gained independence.
- It was a Muslim-majority state led by a Hindu king, who had his own ambitions of leading an independent state attached neither to India nor Pakistan.
- He remained undecided until October 1947 when Pashtun tribals, joined by the Pakistan army, entered the valley to dethrone him.
- Hari Singh also faced rebellion from sections of his own army.
- It was then that he agreed to J&K becoming a part of India under the Instrument of Accession to seek its help so that he could keep his throne.
- The Indian Army thwarted the Pashtun attack.
- Indian records show J&K’s accession was signed on 27 October 1947, after which the army was rushed in.
- Pakistan contests the accession, saying Hari Singh wasn’t in control of the state on that day and
- that the Indian government, led by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, had already pushed in its army and forced the king to sign on the dotted line.
- Pakistan’s objection broadly lay in the accession of a Muslim-majority state to a Hindu-dominated country that contradicted the two-nation theory on which it was founded.


### WHAT IS PAKISTAN-OCCUPIED KASHMIR?
-  As the Indian forces were busy pushing back the Pakistan army to regain control of the territory they had lost to the enemy, Nehru approached the United Nations Security Council on 1 January 1948 to help resolve the dispute.
-  On his request, the UN passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire and asking Pakistan to withdraw from the territory it had occupied.
-  The UN resolution also called upon India to hold a plebiscite in J&K so that the people of the region could determine who they wanted to be with.
-  Pakistan never vacated these areas it had occupied and, thus, India never held the plebiscite.
-  Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), which India’s western neighbour calls Azad Kashmir, is divided into two parts,
  -  Jammu and Kashmir, and 
  -  Gilgit-Baltistan. 
-  India and Pakistan have fought three wars over Kashmir—in 1947-48, 1965 and 1999 (the Kargil war).


### WHAT IS ARTICLE 370?
- Article 370 of the Indian Constitution gave special status and treatment to J&K and its citizens.
- Article 370 was incorporated in the Constitution in 1949, two years after the state had acceded to India.
- It was signed between Hari Singh and Lord Mountbatten, the then Governor General of India, with Nehru’s blessings.
- Barring defence, foreign affairs, finance and communications, the Centre needed the concurrence of the state government to frame laws impacting it under Article 370.
- Article 360 of the Constitution gives the Centre the right to declare financial emergency in a state, but Article 370 prevented the Centre from doing so in the case of J&K, except during war or external aggression.
- The Article gave the state its own Constitution and a flag with various concessions granted to it.


### WHAT IS ARTICLE 35(A)?
-  Article 35(A) was signed between Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah, then the prime minister of the state, in 1954 after the state had become part of India in 1947.
-  It gave the state government the power to define who its resident was.
-  The Article came with retrospective effect, defining a resident of the state as one who had been living there for 10 years.
-  This meant that one could not buy property in the state if one wasn’t a resident there, irrespective of religion.
-  It also meant that while people could vote in the Lok Sabha elections, they could not in municipality or state elections.
-  Indian laws also did not apply on matters of inheritance of property when a Kashmiri woman married a non-Kashmiri.
-  The Supreme Court’s decision to scrap Article 377 that decriminalized homosexuality also did not apply to the state.


### WHAT IS THE OUTCOME OF THE GOVT’S DECISION TO SCRAP ARTICLE 370?
- The government has scrapped Article 370, and with it goes Article 35(A), taking away any special status for J&K.
- The scrapping of Article 370 means that one would be able to settle in J&K, take up a job in the state, buy property there, and enjoy the same laws on property inheritance that citizens in other states do.
- The government has even gone a step ahead.
- It has proposed a bifurcation of the state into J&K and Ladakh, a Hindu-majority area.
- J&K has also lost its status as a state, as both areas are now Union territories (UTs).
- J&K will be a UT with a legislature, while Ladakh will not have a legislature.
- Thus, J&K will be run like Delhi, with powers divided between the lieutenant-governor (LG) and the chief minister,
- while Ladakh will be run like Chandigarh with the LG as its head.
- The decision to scrap Article 370 was done through an executive order of President Ram Nath Kovind.
- The government has already cleared the more difficult test of getting it approved in the Rajya Sabha.
- Given its numbers in Lok Sabha, getting the nod there is a foregone conclusion.

### WHAT LED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THIS DRASTIC STEP?
- The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has stood for the scrapping of J&K’s special status and promised this in its 2019 election manifesto.
- The step taken by the government comes in the wake of a couple of events.
- US President Donald Trump had recently said in a meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had requested him to mediate in the dispute, a statement New Delhi vehemently denied.
- The Indian government’s constant stand has been that the Kashmir problem is a bilateral issue.
- Besides, the US is withdrawing from Afghanistan and there are fears that Pakistan will again prop up the terrorist group Taliban in that country to foment trouble in the region.
- India cannot afford to be a mute spectator to the goings-on in its neighbourhood and the Modi government might have been compelled to act accordingly.

### WHAT ARE THE MAIN POLITICAL FORMATIONS IN THE STATE?
- J&K broadly has three geographical areas—the troubled valley of Kashmir,
  - the plains of Jammu,
  - and the hilly Ladakh. 
- The Congress and the BJP are the main national parties in the state.
- BJP has a strong presence in Jammu and Ladakh but lacks mass support in the valley.
- There are three prominent regional parties
  - Farooq Abdullah’s National Conference,
  - Mehbooba Mufti’s People’s Democratic Party and 
  - National Panthers Party.
- There are other political formations, too, in the state but they have chosen to stay away from taking part in the elections in the state for many years.
- These include the pro-Pakistan All Parties Hurriyat Conference, a political platform that has stood for a J&K state separated from India.
- Then there are terrorist organizations like Lashkar–e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, which derive their support from Pakistan, and are active in the state.
- Several leaders from these organizations are accused of amassing personal wealth at the cost of the locals.

### WHAT IS THE BROADER MESSAGE FROM THIS?
- This decision, that follows the banning of instant triple talaq,
- could be a precursor to the Uniform Civil Code, another avowed objective of the BJP.
- Often, a UT is converted into a state to meet the aspirations of the people.
- This is the first time that a full-fledged state has been bifurcated into two entities which are not even states but UTs.
- This means vastly reduced political heft and powers for its politicians.
- The biggest message of this is that J&K is off any agenda for a bilateral dialogue with Pakistan,
- only extending India’s consistent stand that J&K was its integral part.

### CAN THIS BE CHALLENGED IN COURT?
- Yes, it can, and, in all likelihood, will be challenged in the Supreme Court.
- The argument against the decision will most likely be that Article 370 clearly states that the Centre can frame laws concerning J&K only after consulting the state assembly.
- Those opposed to the move would argue that there is no legislative assembly in the state at present, and, thus, the Centre cannot take a decision like this unilaterally.
- On this, the Centre can argue that there was an emergency situation in the state and that the security of the country was at stake.
- It can say that it took the advice of the governor Satya Pal Malik, the current constitutional head of the state.
