# As fliers return, is it time for airlines to turn a corner?
- Capacity restrictions on airlines operating within the country will be lifted from today.
- The announcement comes amid a rebound in air travel following the devastating second wave of covid-19 infections. Mint explains the implications.

### Why were capacity restrictions imposed?
- Airlines resumed domestic operations on 25 May 2020 after being grounded for two months during the nationwide lockdown.
- As covid infections were still high, airlines were allowed to fly only a third of their pre-covid flights.
- This cap was gradually raised over the following months, first to 45%, next to 60%, and finally increased to 80% by December.
- However, the cap was readjusted again in May 2021 amid the second wave of infections to 50% of their pre-covid capacity.
- A fall in covid infections has led to the current announcement, which appears to be a relief for the industry because of a surge in demand.

### Has domestic air traffic demand recovered?
- Domestic air traffic has been increasing every month since May-end/early June this year or ever since the second wave of the pandemic ebbed.
- Around 6.7 million passengers took to the skies in August, compared to 5.01 million in July, according to the latest data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.
- According to rating agency Icra Ltd, domestic air passenger traffic rose 74% annually and 3% sequentially to 6.9 million in September.
- Most airlines are now optimistic.
- They expect domestic traffic to rebound to pre-covid levels by the end of the current fiscal year or earlier.

### What do the October numbers say?
- Average number of daily fliers stood at 262,000 during the week ending 9 October, against 240,000 the previous week, ICICI Securities said.
- The number of daily flyers touched 30,000 on 9 October, about 75% of pre-covid levels.
- Departures increased to 2,225 from 2,080 the previous week.
- According to aviation website NetworkThoughts, domestic air traffic has recorded the highest figures in a 15-day period since the resumption of air travel last year, at just over 4 million fliers between 1 and 15 October.

### How will the removal of curbs impact ops?
- Airlines are expected to increase their capacities during the ongoing festive season through December and ahead, as more Indians are expected to take to the skies.
- Interestingly, most travel in the domestic segment continues to be VFR travel—Visiting Friends and Relatives.
- Corporate travel is yet to return to its pre-covid levels.
- But a cap on fares still continues, though its rollover period has been cut to 15 days from 30 days earlier.
- The removal of fare caps will lead to a faster revival, as India is a highly price sensitive market.

### How is air traffic expected to fare in 2021?
- Domestic air passenger traffic is expected to surge 52% this fiscal year,
- while international passenger traffic is expected to rise 60%, according to data from aviation consultancy Capa India.
- However, air passenger traffic is expected to remain well below the figures recorded in 2019-20, prior to the covid-19 outbreak, the report added.
