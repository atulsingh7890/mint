# Green hydrogen: Make hay while the sun shines
- Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani’s recent announcement to bring the cost of green hydrogen to under $2 per kg by 2030 sent a clear message to the global energy community that the fuel has the potential to be a game changer for India.

### What does the announcement mean?
- The cost of green hydrogen made by electrolysis is estimated to be around ₹350 per kg and the Centre plans to bring it down to ₹160 per kg by 2029-30.
- Ambani also said India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under $1 per kg new-age emission free fuel cost within a decade.
- Such low pricing will make India’s plan to build green hydrogen plants to run on electricity produced by green energy sources a value proposition.
- Apart from providing grid-scale storage solutions and feedstock for ammonia production,
- hydrogen can be used for fuel cells and is being leveraged for mobility applications and transportation.

### Is all that glitters really gold?
- Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyzer powered by electricity from green energy sources such as wind and solar.
- With most parts of India receiving 4-7 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of solar energy per square metre per day,
- the green hydrogen play looks like an ideal solution to help India meet its energy needs.
- India’s large landmass and low wind and solar tariff can be leveraged to produce low-cost green hydrogen and ammonia for exports,
- thus bolstering India’s geopolitical heft.
- Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 15 August announced a National Hydrogen Mission.

### What are the planned policy interventions?
- The Union government plans to implement the green hydrogen consumption obligation (GHCO) in fertilizer production and petroleum refining,
- similar to what was done with renewable purchase obligations (RPO).
- Also, India plans to shortly kick-start the play by calling bids for 4 GW electrolyzer capacity and extending the PLI scheme for manufacturing electrolyzers.
- Also, the draft Electricity Rules, 2021, floated by the power ministry have allowed green hydrogen purchase to help meet RPOs.

### What is being done at present?
- A raft of Indian firms, including NTPC Renewable Energy, have forayed into green hydrogen play.
- The NTPC unit is setting up India’s largest solar park of 4.75 GW in Gujarat and plans to make green hydrogen there on a commercial scale.
- NTPC has also called bids for setting up a pilot project for mixing green hydrogen with natural gas for the city gas distribution network.
- Input requirements are in place to drive production cost down with more than half of 817 GW of India’s electricity requirement is to be met from clean energy by 2030.

### Will this result in large savings?
- India spends around ₹12 trillion annually for its energy needs.
- Any savings because of reduced energy imports following the domestic ramp up of green hydrogen production will be a boon.
- The valuable foreign exchange savings can be deployed towards infrastructure creation, health and education.
- It will also help India meet its nationally determined contribution targets.
