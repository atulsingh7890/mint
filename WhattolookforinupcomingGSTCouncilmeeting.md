# What to look for in upcoming GST Council meeting
- The goods and services tax (GST) Council will soon meet to discuss extension of GST compensation to states beyond 2022,
- and will attempt to fix certain tax anomalies. Mint takes a look at the implications for consumers and businesses.

### What issues are likely to figure in the meet?
- The council is expected to examine demands from states for extending the period of GST compensation beyond June 2022,
- when the five-year transition period into the new indirect tax system ends.
- Many states are facing financial hardship because of higher spending needs during the pandemic.
- GST compensation is financed by a cess levied on items such as cars, aerated drinks and tobacco products, as well as commodities such as coal and lignite.
- Another task before the council is pruning the list of items under the ‘nil’ tax category.
- Fixing the tax anomaly of certain raw materials getting taxed more than finished goods is also on the cards.

### What’ll compensation cess extension mean?
- The Union government is already borrowing from the market to finance GST compensation to states for FY21 and FY22 because the cess collected is not sufficient.
- To pay back this borrowing, the GST cess will have to be extended beyond 2022.
- Accepting the demand of states for a further extension of the compensation period would mean that the GST cess on items such as automobiles, tobacco products and coal will have to continue for longer.
- That time period would also depend on how long and by how much GST compensation will be paid to states beyond June 2022.

### What’s the tax anomaly that has to be fixed?
- The inverted duty structure, or the tax outgo on raw materials and services, being higher than that on the finished products has been a headache for the authorities and businesses.
- This is severe in the case of items such as footwear valued up to ₹1,000, fabrics and garments, fertilizers and pharma-ceuticals.
- It would be unpopular to raise the tax on the mass-use final product.
- However, the inverted duty structure forces producers to recover taxes they have paid on raw materials and services by raising prices of finished products.

### What would be the impact of correcting it?
- There could be a marginal rise in the tax outgo of products when the inverted duty structure is corrected.
- Policymakers are expected to evaluate that against the economic benefits of correcting it, including a possible reduction in litigation.
- Despite the economic rationale for having moderate taxation, the rate is kept at the lowest 5% on many items because of political and social reasons.
- This consideration to keep tax rates low on mass use items is likely to be a key factor while addressing the problem of inverted duty structure.

### What products are in the zero-tax category?
- Many food items including fish, egg, meat, milk, puja items, plastic bangles, printed books, contraceptives, raw silk, khadi yarn and postal envelopes sold by the government are in the zero-rate category.
- Pruning exemptions are expected to widen the tax base.
- However, political considerations are expected to play a role in the council’s decision-making.
