# What  explains  the irrational rally in DHFL’s shares?
- The shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) have been rising continuously,
- even though the company is about to delist its shares from the exchanges as part of its bankruptcy resolution. Mint explains why the stock is on a high.

### What’s going on with DHFL’s shares?
- Since 18 May, the shares of DHFL, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), have been rising consistently.
- The stock gained 51.82%, rising from ₹15 to ₹22.85.
- In June alone, the stock rose 27% after rallying 17% in May.
- But the stock is down 23% in this year so far, following a 76% jump in 2020.
- Starting 13 November 2020, the stock hit the upper circuit for 19 days, jumping from ₹15.60 to ₹41.70, making a gain of 167.30%.
- However, the rally fizzled out, with the stock hitting the lower circuit for seven sessions.
- On Tuesday, the stock closed at ₹22.85, up ₹2.05 or 9.86%.

### Is the stock euphoria rational?
- Analysts say it is not.
- Two primary reasons are driving the stock, they said.
- First, investors are hopeful that a plea filed in the Delhi high court by depositors challenging the constitutional validity of the financial service providers rule under the Insolvency and Bank-ruptcy Code will offer good news.
- Second, stocks in the news have a tendency to fall prey to speculative trading, despite the fundamentals.
- “Equity shares of DHFL are likely to be extinguished as part of its acquisition because of NCLT’s insolvency process.
- There can be a significant risk of you losing your entire investment by trading in this stock,” Zerodha said.

### What is DHFL’s shareholding pattern?
- Retail investors hold most of the stake in DHFL, according to BSE.
- In the March quarter, retail investors held 42.19% of the stock, which is a significant rise from the 21.55% in March 2019 and 38.67% in March 2020.
- Foreign institutional investors have, in contrast, reduced their stake.
- In March 2019, they held 17.65%.
- This came down to a mere 1.92% in March 2021.
- LIC’s holding has been constant at 3.44%.
- Mutual funds holdings were at 0.01% in March 2021, down from 1.09% in the corresponding month of 2019.

### What does the DHFL deal hold for Piramal?
- The acquisition is a step towards the demerger of the group’s financial services and pharmaceuticals businesses, according to analysts.
- On the business side, the proposed acquisition will also help Piramal Capital and Housing Finance diversify its loan book into the retail segment and improve the mix between wholesale and retail.
- The asset quality of DHFL’s retail loan book, however, remains a key monitorable.
- Business integration may also take some time.

### How is Piramal going to acquire DHFL?
- Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd has offered ₹37,250 crore to DHFL’s creditors, including a payment of ₹12,700 crore in cash upfront, ₹3,000 crore in interest income on DHFL’s books, and non-convertible debentures worth ₹19,550 crore to be repaid over 10 years.
- DHFL shares will be delisted after the acquisition.
