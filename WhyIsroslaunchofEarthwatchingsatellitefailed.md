# Why Isro’s launch of Earth-watching satellite failed
- The Indian Space Research Organization’s (Isro’s) plans to position a sophisticated Earth observation satellite (EOS-03) in space failed on Thursday,
- as GSLV-F10’s cryogenic upper stage ignition failed to kick in during a crucial phase.
- Mint looks at the reasons behind the failure:

### What were the reasons for the failure?
- The launch took place from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, at 05.43 am on 12 August.
- While the first two stages of the three-stage launch were successful, failure in the third stage prevented the successful placement of the satellite in orbit.
- **GSLV-F10 launch took place today at 0543 Hrs IST as scheduled.**
- **Performance of first and second stages was normal.**
- **However, cryogenic upper stage ignition did not happen due to technical anomaly.**
- **The mission couldn’t be accomplished as intended,** Isro tweeted.
- As a result, the satellite failed to carry its payload to its destination.

### What is a cryogenic stage in a launch?
- Rockets require thrust to reach the desired location in space.
- Cryogenic engines use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen which propel rockets into orbit.
- Cryogenic stage is considered a more efficient rocket launch method, providing more thrust for every kilogramme of propellant burnt compared to solid and Earth-storable liquid propellant rocket stages.
- Specific impulse achievable with cryogenic propellants is also much higher compared to Earth-storable liquid and solid propellants, giving it a substantial payload advantage.
- Two gimballed steering engines provide for control of the stage during its thrusting phase.

### Why is cryogenic stage so challenging?
- Cryogenic stage is a very complex system because of its use of propellants at extremely low temperatures and the associated thermal and structural problems.
- For instance, oxygen liquifies at -183 degrees C and hydrogen at -253 degrees C.
- The propellants at these low temperatures are pumped using turbo pumps running at around 40,000 rpm.
- It also entails complex ground support systems like propellant storage and filling systems, cryo engine and stage test facilities, handling of cryo fluids, and related safety aspects.

### What is next for the space agency?
- This was Isro’s first GSLV launch after the 2019 Chandrayaan-2 mission.
- The space agency had earlier in February successfully launched Brazil’s Amazonia-1 along with 18 co-passenger satellites using PSLV-C51.
- Much of the space projects though have been delayed due to the covid-19 pandemic.
- However, Isro is expected to launch some space projects in coming months, including the launch of EOS-04 sometime in the month of September.
- This will, however, be launched on a PSLV.

### What was the objective of this space mission?
- GSLV-F10 was to place EOS-03 in geostationary transfer orbit.
- The satellite was to be one of the country’s most sophisticated Earth imaging satellites.
- EOS-03 was to play a key role in providing real-time assistance and monitoring phenomena like floods, cyclones and other natural disasters, security threats, agriculture and forests cover.
