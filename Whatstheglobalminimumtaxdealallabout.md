# What’s the global minimum tax deal all about?
- The finance ministers of G-20 countries are scheduled to meet today in Washington to discuss the global minimum tax of 15% for multinational enterprises.
- Mint looks at the global minimum tax and its implications.

### What is the global minimum tax?
- Last week, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) finalized a landmark agreement to subject multinational enterprises (MNEs) to a minimum 15% tax from 2023.
- A total of 136 countries, including India, have agreed to join the historic agreement.
- This will help reallocate profits of over $125 billion from over 100 large MNEs to help ensure companies pay a fair share of tax in the countries they operate in.
- In a digitalized and globalized world economy, this deal brings in a fundamental reform in international tax rules.

### What is the ‘Two Pillar’ solution?
- The Two Pillar solution of the OECD seeks to address tax challenges that are an outcome of digitalization of the world economy.
- Under Pillar 1, taxing rights on more than $125 billion of profit are anticipated to be reallocated to market jurisdictions each year.
- A global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% is sought to be introduced 
- under Pillar 2. This minimum tax rate will apply to companies with revenues over €750 million 
- and the prediction is that it would help generate about $150 billion in global tax revenues on an annual basis.

### Will it eliminate tax competition?
- The deal doesn’t seek to eliminate tax competition.
- Rather, it would ensure a fairer allocation of profit and taxing rights among countries,
- especially with reference to large and profitable MNEs such as Apple Inc., Google Llc, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. etc.
- It would help re-allocate the right to levy taxes from the home country of MNEs to the host nations where they do business
- whether they have a physical presence or not.
- This will ensure that MNEs with global sales of over €20 billion and profitability of over 10% are covered by the rules.

### And the implications for India?
- The tax deal will mean removal of existing digital service taxes and other unilateral measures by 2023.
- India will need to withdraw the equalization levy that was introduced in 2016.
- This levy was aimed at taxing foreign firms that have a substantial client base in the country, but were billing via their offshore units.
- Experts believe the tax would be advantageous for India as the effective domestic tax rate is above the threshold and India,
- being a large potential market, would continue to attract foreign investments.

### What was the trigger for such a deal?
- Due to the pandemic and the resulting financial crisis, countries are looking for alternative and innovative sources of revenue to rejuvenate their economies.
- But large MNEs route their profits through low tax jurisdictions.
- This new pact helps ensure that MNEs pay their fair share of taxes due in countries where they operate and earn profits.
