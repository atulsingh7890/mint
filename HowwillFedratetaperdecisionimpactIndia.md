# How will Fed rate taper decision impact India?
- Indian markets surged on Thursday,
- despite the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on reducing its monthly bond purchases and hints of earlier-than-anticipated interest rate hikes.
- Mint explains how the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision may impact India.

### What was the outcome of the FOMC meet?
- Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said if the US economy continues to strengthen,
- the central bank would soon dial down its monthly asset purchases of $120 billion and conclude the tapering process by mid-2022.
- Although the Fed did not set a date to start the tapering process,
- it has indicated that it could be as early as its next scheduled monetary policy meeting in November.
- The policy rates have remained unchanged since mid-March 2020,
- when it was reduced by 100 basis points (bps) in an emergency move in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

### What were the key policy statements?
- The Fed held its current target interest rate steady in a range of 0% to 0.25%,
- and said its accommodative policy will be maintained until the US economy achieves maximum employment and inflation is at the 2% target.
- The Fed will purchase $80 billion of treasury securities and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities per month.
- Powell also said the debt problems of property developer Evergrande seem specific to China, and there is no parallel with the US corporate sector.
- “China has very high debt for an emerging market economy,” the Federal Reserve chairman said.

### Why are monetary policies divergent?
- So far in 2021, 12 major emerging market central banks have started rate hike cycles, of which 10 are outside of Asia.
- Central banks will find it challenging to exit their ultra-accommodative policies, analysts say.
- The Bank of Korea was the first out of the ranks, but it is not clear whether it is the right policy.
- If Asian central banks remain accommodative for far too long, this could result in two medium-term risks:
- inflation in emerging markets in Asia, and a debt build-up in developed markets in Asia, said Nomura.

### Will RBI normalize policy rates now?
- While the tapering of US asset purchases will have implications on the flow of funds into India, it is unlikely to be immediate.
- The monetary policy of Reserve Bank of India RBI would continue to be driven by domestic considera-tions of economic growth,
- but towards this end,
- it would continue to maintain its accommodative monetary policy, said Care Ratings.
- India has the highest inflation rate in the region, but RBI is tolerant.
- Nomura sees policy normalization starting with a calibrated normalization of liquidity in Q4.

### How does the FOMC meet outcome impact India?
- Ultra-loose monetary policies by global central banks attracted massive funds into emerging markets.
- Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pumped $7.94 billion into Indian equities so far this year.
- The Sensex and the Nifty have gained 23-25% in 2021.
- But higher interest rates will tempt large foreign funds to shift their money back to the US,
- which will affect local markets.
