# What do CBDT’s sops  mean for  Air India  sale  process?
- The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Friday and Saturday came up with a host of clarifications
- that may sweeten the process for privatization of ailing public carrier Air India,
- ahead of the deadline for financial bids from selected bidders by 15 September. Mint explains:

### Notification on capital assets transfer
- The government had in 2019 set up a special purpose vehicle, Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL),
- for transfer of debt and non-core assets of the Air India group.
- In a set of notifications on Saturday, CBDT said tax deducted at source (TDS) will not be applicable for transfer of goods and immovable property by Air India Ltd to AIAHL.
- It also said that the transfer of capital assets from Air India Ltd to AIAHL
- under the plan approved by the Centre would not be regarded as transfer for the purpose of income tax.
- This would provide legal certainty and reduce tax liability on Air India following the privatization.

#### Clarification on carrying forward losses
- Section 79 of the Income Tax Act means that following a change in ownership of a company,
- the new owner cannot carry forward past losses and claim tax rebate against future profits.
- This would mean that the future owner of Air India can also not claim tax rebates against the huge pile of debt it will have on taking over the carrier.
- But the finance ministry on Friday clarified that this clause will not be applicable to strategic disinvest-ments where ownership changes from the government to a private firm.
- The CBDT clarification means bidders may be more willing to carry more debt with Air India and quote a higher enterprise value.

### How are bidders going to decide the bid value?\
- Air India has accumulated losses of ₹70,820 crore till 31 March 2020.
- The Centre had initially decided to carry forward ₹23,000 crore debt to the successful bidder.
- But in October last year, it said bids would be on enterprise value, giving bidders freedom to decide how much debt they want to carry.
- The government decided that the successful bidder will have to give it 15% of the enterprise value quoted as cash and carry 85% as debt along with Air India.
- The higher the enterprise value quoted, the better the chances of winning the bid.

### What is the status of disinvestment plan?
- The Centre has so far garnered ₹8,369 crore, against the disinvest-ment target of ₹1.75 trillion for FY22.
- It has sold its entire stake in Axis Bank held through Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) for ₹3,994 crore and got ₹3,654 crore and ₹720 crore through stake sales in NMDC Ltd and Hudco Ltd, respectively.
- But with big ticket disinvestments such as the privatization of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd
- and the mega share sale of LIC lined up, the government is hopeful of meeting its target by 31 March 2022.

## Who has shown interest in bidding for Air India?
- The Tata group is among the front runners to acquire the airline.
- According to media reports, SpiceJet’s chairman and managing director Ajay Singh has also been short-listed to bid for Air India in his individual capacity.
- Mint could not independently ascertain this.
- The government does not make public the shortlisted qualified bidders before the process is completed.
