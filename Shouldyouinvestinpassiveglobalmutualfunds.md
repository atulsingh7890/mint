# Should  you  invest in passive global mutual funds?
- HDFC Mutual Fund is launching a Fund of Funds (FoF) tracking the MSCI World Index.
- So far, FoFs have targeted individual countries or smaller regions such as East Asia
-  Mint explains how global passive funds could work for Indian investors.

### What is a global passive FoF?
- A passive mutual fund seeks to replicate an index like the Nifty or the Sensex rather than beat it.
- So costs are lower than actively managed mutual funds.
- A global passive FoF will track a global index such as the MSCI World Index, which invests in only developed countries, not emerging markets.
- This may open the door for FoFs tracking truly global indices such as the MSCI All Country World Index or the FTSE Global All Cap Index.
- Navi Mutual Fund has filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for a fund feeding into a Vanguard US stock market Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).

### What are their advantages?
- Passive mutual funds have been around since 2011.
- However, they have focused on a single country and tilt toward a particular sector like technology.
- A global passive FoF eliminates such biases and allows your money to be spread across countries and sectors.
- So, if for instance, there’s a change in the world’s economic balance toward fast growing economies in East Asia, you will not lose out.
- Secondly, global indices tend to have low correlations with India.
- Hence, Indian investors suffer less volatility in their portfolio.
- Third, you benefit from the low expenses that passive funds have, compared to active funds.

### What about currency exchange?
- You can invest in such FoFs in Indian rupees and their NAV is declared in rupees.
- However, since they invest in foreign markets, their value fluctuates.
- Typically, the Indian rupee depreciates over time against developed market currencies such as the dollar and the euro, so their values rise over time.
- This adds a strong tailwind to such funds which domestic funds lack.
- Global FoFs will gain if the basket of currencies they invest in does better than the rupee and is not dependent on any single currency like the dollar.

### What are the disadvantages?
- If the Indian stock market continues to outperform its peers across the world,
- an international FoF will do worse than a domestic index fund or an actively managed fund.
- The tax treatment of such FoFs is less favourable than equity mutual funds in India, which are taxed 10% on capital gains above ₹1 lakh if held for more than a year.
- International passive FoFs also give up the possibility of beating world indices through active fund management.
- Also, so far, no such fund has been structured to move between asset classes.

### How are returns on these funds taxed?
- If you redeem the fund within three years, you are taxed at your slab rate, like a debt MF.
- After three years, the tax is 20% with indexation.
- The fund may face taxes by foreign countries on income such as dividends.
- However, if the money is routed through favourable jurisdictions, as is the case with the HDFC FoF, the loss gets minimized.
