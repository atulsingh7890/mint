# How  new account aggregator  system could benefit you
- The account aggregator system in banking has kicked off with eight of India’s largest banks,
- including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.
- When fully functional, the system can make lending and wealth management a lot faster and cheaper. Mint explains:

### What are account aggregators?
- Account aggregators are entities licensed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to collect and share financial information.
- When you apply for a bank loan, you can ask an account aggregator to collect information about all your bank accounts or other assets and submit it to the lender.
- This can establish your eligibility for the loan.
- Since the account aggregator sources information directly from a financial institution, it will be considered authentic and the lender does not need to worry about fake documents.
- All of this is done electronically, reducing cost and time taken for physical paperwork.

### How does the system work?
- The account aggregator system has three components:
  - Financial Information Users (FIUs),
  - Financial Information Providers (FIPs), and
  - account aggregators.
- The FIU requests the data, the FIP provides it, and the aggregator is the intermediary acting under your instructions.
- You sign up on the aggregator’s platform and link your bank accounts and other financial records to it.
- Thereafter, you authorize third parties who are on-boarded as FIUs to fetch the information for the purpose you have in mind.
- For example, your wealth manager can be an FIP and it might need to get quarterly statements of all your investments.

### What about privacy and consent?
- The idea behind the new system is to enable you to give informed consent for data sharing.
- It will allow you to share specific information for a specific period.
- For example, you authorize the aggregator to share your bank account statement for a particular account for the last three years with a lender.
- The information being shared will be limited to that bank account and the time period mentioned.
- You will also have redressal options in case your information is shared without your consent.

### Where is this system headed?
- Although it is currently confined to areas under four regulators—RBI, Sebi, Irdai and PFRDA,
- talks are on to add more sources of information such as goods and service tax and income tax.
- These can help with areas like loan approval and wealth management.
- For instance, a tap of the finger could allow the aggregator to share your verified income tax returns with a bank which you have approached for a loan.
- Eventually, even documents like covid-19 vaccination certificates could become part of the system.

### What will the new system cost you?
- The aggregator can either charge you or the FIU (data user) in question.
- The costs will be determined by each aggregator individually.
- However, due to the online nature of this system, they are likely to be low.
- In some cases, they might cut down on charges that you already have to bear when it comes to information verification.
- Take loan processing charges, for example.
