# Can a new policy help India bump up job creation?
- A proposed government committee to draft a national employment policy is expected to come out with a roadmap to increase employment opportunities.
- Mint explains how the policy could work and its potential impact on the economy.

### What is the panel’s objective?
- With renewed focus on employ-ment following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Centre has proposed a committee to draft guidelines for a national employment policy.
- Data for current weekly employment status in urban areas shows that unemployment rate (UR), which peaked at 20.8% in April-June 2020, fell to 10.3% in October-December 2020.
- The panel will work to create a roadmap to generate employment opportunities in India.
- Work has begun to identify its members, including representatives from the labour ministry, other ministries, academia, and industry experts.

### What could be the focus of the policy?
- The panel might suggest sector-wise targets for jobs.
- Given the expected boost for employment from the recent production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes and the increased demand for gig workers,
- its aim would be to facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for startups and new industries to generate jobs,
- improve the skill sets of workers and make them employment-ready.
- A greater focus on female workforce participation is expected.
- The panel might also announce incentives for job creation.
- The recommendations may be based on data received from the ongoing labour surveys.

### What could be a balanced approach?
- The government should think in terms of a ‘national economic policy’, rather than looking at one particular by-product i.e. employ-ment generation.
- Employment generation ratio is bound to differ from sector to sector.
- The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) for April-June 2021 showed that manufacturing accounted for 41% employment,
- followed by education at 22%, health at 8%, and trade and IT/ ITeS at 7%.
- It is important that national priorities be decided on the basis of aspirations of the society.

### Who should the nodal agency be?
- With the Centre keen to attract domestic and foreign investors into employment-intensive sectors and make the country a global manufacturing hub,
- the aim is to lay out a sector-wise strategy.
- The nodal agency could be a separate ministry for economic affairs.
- It could also be implemented under the ministry of finance or the PMO.
- The task of drafting the policy should not be left only to the ministry of labour and employment.


### What is the current unemployment scenario?
- According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), India’s unemployment rate was 7.75% in October 2021, against 11.84% and 9.17% in May and June 2021.
- It is worth stating that these numbers need to be considered with caution as CMIE estimates are based on a small sample size of 44,600 households per month spread across the country.
