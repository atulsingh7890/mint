# What is in store for accredited investors  in  India?
- The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has come up with a framework creating so-called accredited investors,
- with relaxations for high-value investment vehicles.
- While details are awaited, a previous Sebi consultation paper provides an outline. Mint takes a look:

### Who is an accredited investor?
- A Sebi consultation paper in February 2021 defined an accredited individual investor as someone who satisfies at least one of three conditions.
- One, the investor has a net worth of ₹7.5 crore, with at least half of it in financial assets.
- Two, the investor has an annual income greater than ₹2 crore.
- Three, the individual has an annual income greater than ₹1 crore and net worth greater than ₹5 crore with at least half this amount in financial assets.
- For trusts and body corporates, the net worth threshold is ₹50 crore.
- The primary residence of an individual cannot be counted in the net worth calculation.

### What relaxations has the  regulator  proposed?
- Currently, those interested in portfolio management schemes (PMS) and alternative investment funds (AIFs) must invest at least ₹50 lakh and ₹1 crore, respectively;
- these thresholds won’t apply to accredited investors.
- Second, current rules mandate AIFs to make diversified investments, with strict conditions for launch of schemes, and extension of tenure.
- Sebi has proposed to allow the formation of AIFs where these rules are more relaxed, creating a potential high-return, high-risk investment avenue, but open only to accredited investors.
- They must invest a minimum of ₹70 crore in such AIFs.

### What are the changes for advisers?
- Accredited investors will have the flexibility to determine the limits and modes of fees payable to the investment adviser through mutually negotiated contractual terms.
- For other investors, Sebi has fixed a ceiling of ₹1.25 lakh if a flat fee is charged, and 2.5% of assets under advice if a fee linked to assets is charged.
- Investment advisers can only collect fees for a maximum of two quarters in advance.
- This structure may not be suitable for high net-worth investors who may be willing to pay a high flat fee.
- Accreditation will solve this issue.

### Are there any concerns about the framework?
- The focus on net worth rather than financial knowledge or experience in the consultation paper can be somewhat restrictive.
- There may be wealthy individuals who are not financially savvy or highly knowledgeable small investors who do not satisfy the net worth requirements for accreditation.
- Basing income and net worth on a single year’s income tax return, as suggested in the paper, may not be comprehensive enough.
- It may also create a new ‘class system’ in financial services with greater flexibility for the privileged few.

### How do such investors get accredited?
- The Sebi paper says there will be accreditation agencies to conduct the process, likely to be stock exchanges, depositories or subsidiaries of stock exchanges/depositories.
- The accreditation will be valid for one year from the date of accreditation.
- It is not clear if Sebi will prescribe any knowledge or expertise test in the final accreditation framework.
