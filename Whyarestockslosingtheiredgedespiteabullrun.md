# Why are stocks losing their edge despite a bull run?
- Global analysts are sounding the alarm on India’s equity performance.
- They are becoming uncomfortable about steep valuations and hence are cautious about allocation of funds despite India outperforming global peers in 2021 so far.
- Mint explains:

### Why has Nomura downgraded India?
- Nomura has downgraded Indian markets to neutral from over-weight rating citing unfavourable risk-reward because of high valuations.
- A number of positives appear to be priced in, it said, even as headwinds emerge.
- The Japanese brokerage prefers China and Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), instead, and will be looking for better entry points for India.
- In February this year, Nomura upgraded India to overweight, citing fiscal activism and declining covid-19 cases.
- Almost 77% of Indian stocks in the MSCI index are trading higher than pre- pandemic or post 2018 average valuations.

### Are Indian equities no longer attractive?
- Last week, UBS reiterated its underweight rating on India calling it ‘extremely expensive’.
- UBS finds Indian equities unattractive because of higher valuations.
- The earnings momentum, meanwhile, is losing steam and an economic rebound this year looks unlikely.
- Global fund managers are no longer bullish on emerging markets, showed a BofA survey.
- It said fund managers are underweight on EMs and want to cut exposure in the next 12 months as China fears weighed on sentiment.
- Global fund managers’ allocation to EM equities in October slumped to the lowest since September 2018.

### Are Indian valuations really steep?
- The Sensex is currently available at a one-year forward price to earnings (PE) of 23.62 times, whereas the Nifty is at 22.28 times.
- In comparison, the MSCI World is trading at 19.22 times and the MSCI Emerging Markets at 13.02 times.
- However, the Sensex and the Nifty have gained 28-30% in 2021 so far against a 17% jump of the MSCI World and 0.46% of the MSCI EM.
- The number of companies trading at a PE higher than 25 times has risen from 11 in March 2020 to 25 in September 2021.

### Are markets ahead of fundamentals?
- Headwinds in India such as policy normalization amid sticky core inflation, elevated commodity prices, and tentative signs of a slowdown in consumption are worrying, said Nomura.
- Another near-term risk is a likely reversal in retail ebullience once back-to-work normalizes.
- India may not look that steep if we compare earnings yield to bond yields, said Unmesh Sharma, head of institutional equities, HDFC Securities.
- “There is some discomfort on the aggregate level of valuations, but we believe there are opportunities in the market.”

### How is this going to impact liquidity?
- Markets seem to be losing institutional liquidity support this month.
- Foreign institutional investors have sold Indian shares worth $41.77 million in October so far after a net inflow of $1.84 billion in the previous two months.
- Domestic institutional investors have dumped equities worth ₹5,986.21 crore this month so far.
