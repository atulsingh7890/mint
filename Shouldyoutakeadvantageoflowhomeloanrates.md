# Should you take advantage of low home loan rates?
- This week, Housing Development Finance Corp. joined State Bank of India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Bank of Baroda in cutting home loan rates.
- These rate cuts are being offered to both salaried and non-salaried borrowers.
- Mint takes a look:

### Should  you  buy a home because rates are low?
- Home loan interest rates are just one of the several factors to be taken into consideration while buying a house.
- Financial advisors generally advise buying a house if you are buying it to live in and not as an investment.
- This is because a home purchase for most individuals is a large, illiquid, and undiversified investment.
- In other words, you cannot sell a house quickly if you need the money, and you cannot easily sell just a part of it if you need a small amount of money.
- This is different from investing in equities and mutual funds, which can be sold more quickly and in parts.

### Should you buy house if you are renting one?
- In today’s economy, people often change jobs and change the cities of their residence.
- Buying a home in one city makes this process more difficult and reduces your ability to move.
- The covid-19 pandemic has also brought with it the trend of people in different fields working from home.
- This has reduced the need to buy expensive homes in big cities.
- On the flip side, buying a home helps save on rent and this can be a financial net positive in the long run.
- Compare the costs of buying a house with the annual rental cost, before making a decision.

### What about the tax savings?
- You get a deduction up to ₹1.5 lakh under Section 80 C for principal repayment of a home loan and a deduction up to ₹2 lakh on interest payments under Section 24B.
- If you account for these deductions, the effective rate of interest on your home loan falls.
- However, Section 80 C can also be used for other kinds of investments such as equity linked savings schemes (ELSS), or public provident fund (PPF).
- Money used on home loan interest could also be used to get tax deductions elsewhere such as National Pension System contributions.

### Can you lock in the low rates?
- The short answer is no.
- In most home loans, the interest rate is variable in nature.
- It moves up and down in sync with overall rates in the economy.
- Most banks have linked their home loan rates to an external benchmark, usually the repo rate of the Reserve Bank of India.
- The home loan rate of banks is set at a certain premium to the repo rate based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and moves in tandem with the repo rate.
- If the repo rate goes up, your EMI will also go up.

### What are the costs that home buying entails?
- Buying a house involves making a down payment from your own savings.
- Then there is the equated monthly instalments (EMIs) to be paid on a home loan, if one is taken.
- Other costs include stamp duty, brokerage and registration fee, as well as the cost of regular maintenance, parking slot charges, property tax, and the cost of repairs.
