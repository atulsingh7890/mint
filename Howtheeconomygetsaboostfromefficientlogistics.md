# How the economy gets a boost from efficient logistics
- The government released the annual Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) report for 2021 last week,
- which ranked Gujarat at the top.
- Mint explores how an efficient logistic environment can support the economy.

### What does the LEADS 2021 report show?
- Launched in 2018, the commerce ministry’s survey-based LEADS report ranks states and Union territories (UTs) on the efficiency of their logistics ecosystem,
- and aims to induce stakeholders to make necessary improvements.
- Gujarat, Haryana, and Punjab were the top performers in LEADS 2021, while Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, and Assam ranked at the bottom.
- Within UTs, Delhi secured the first position.
- Relative to the rankings in LEADS 2019, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand have emerged as the top improvers.
- An efficient supply chain and logistics network are critical to improving competitiveness in all sectors.

### What are the parameters?
- The survey parameters are based on three key pillars—infra-structure, services, and operating and regulatory environment.
- The survey, which evaluates prevailing export-import and domestic logistics network, has 21 indicators, including 17 perception indicators and four objective indicators.
- Quality of rail, road, uni- and multi-modal infrastructure, warehousing infrastructure, quality, and capability of logistics service providers, timeliness of cargo delivery, efficiency of regulatory services etc. are measured under perception-based indicators.
- Objective indicators assess state or UT’s enabling initiatives.

### How will efficient logistics help?
- Improved supply chain efficiencies will help bring down logistics costs and act as an enabler in enhancing industry competitiveness.
- India’s logistics cost is approximately 13-14% of its gross domestic product (GDP), while that of developed countries is in the range of 8-10%.
- With the country aspiring to be a manufacturing destination, an improved logistics environment will benefit production, distribution, and trade activities, and generate better economies of scale, minimizing cost per unit, leading to lower prices for the consumer.

### What is the government’s plan?
- The Centre’s aim is to bring down logistics costs in India by 4-5% of GDP over the next five years to approximately 8% of GDP.
- Some of the initiatives undertaken are:
  - On an international level,
  - the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative,
  - and on the domestic front,
- infrastructure development initiatives such as Sagarmala, Bharatmala, Dedicated Freight Corridors; 
- paperless EXIM trade process through E-Sanchit, mandatory electronic toll collection system (FASTag) etc.

### Is there a global measurement index?
- The World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index ranks 160 countries on efficiency of customs clearance;
- quality of trade and transport infrastructure;
- ease of arranging competitively priced shipments;
- compete-nce and quality of logistics services;
- ability to track and trace consignments.
- India was ranked 44th in 2018 as against 35th in 2016, and 54th in 2014.
