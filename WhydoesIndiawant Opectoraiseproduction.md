# Why does India want  Opec+ to raise  production?
- India has been pressing the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to balance the interests of crude suppliers and consumers for long.
- It is expected to discuss oil prices with Opec secretary general Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo who is now in Delhi.

### Why are low oil prices crucial for India?
- India has been requesting the Opec+ that also includes Russia to raise production to soothe global energy markets,
- and has pointed out that a high price regime will kill the nascent economic recovery and the demand for energy.
- India has also raised the issue with major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, US, and Russia.
- India is dependent on imports to meet 85% of its oil demand and 55% of its natural gas requirements.
- It is also the world’s third largest oil importer.
- Opec accounts for the majority of India’s crude oil imports and around 40% of global production.

### How has been Opec’s response?
- India’s repeated requests have been rebuffed by the oil cartel, which has decided to keep supplies just below demand to sustain high oil prices.
- With India’s consumption around 15–16% higher than the pre-covid levels, there aren’t many options to temper fuel prices.
- India is particularly at a disadvantage as any increase in global prices can affect its import bill, stoke inflation and increase its trade deficit.
- Petrol and diesel were selling at a record high of ₹106.19 and ₹94.92 per litre, respectively, in Delhi on Wednesday,
- while Brent was trading at $84.53 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $82.26 a barrel at the time of filing of this story.

### How is India dealing with the high prices?
- As the prices remain high, India has begun selling crude oil from its strategic petroleum reserves to state-run refiners.
- The plan is to replenish them when prices are comparatively lower.
- The storage capacity is, however, limited at 5.3 million tonne (mt), enough to support only around nine and a half days of India’s oil requirements.
- The government in June 2018 also approved the construction of an additional 6.5 mt of strategic crude oil reserves to support 12 days of crude oil requirements.
- Indian refiners also store crude oil.

### What long-term steps can India take?
- Apart from staying the green energy course, India will also have to raise the domestic oil & gas production to successfully manage its energy transition.
- While India’s domestic oil production continues to falter, there has been an uptick in gas production.
- Any rise in domestic production will help cut imports and save valuable foreign exchange.
- India does have some leverage given the quantum of oil it buys.
- Even acquiring overseas assets has not worked very well for India, given the countries where these assets are located are part of Opec+.

### What else does India seek from Opec?
- India has requested a reduction in official selling price, extension of credit period from existing 30 days to 90 days from bill of lading,
- freight discount, and open credit based on creditworthiness of Indian state-run refineries.
- It has also sought a price and terms correction on the so-called Asian premium,
- a burden on nations dependent on West Asia to meet their energy needs.
