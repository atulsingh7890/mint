## Wake-up call for India’s healthcare infrastructure
- The pandemic has shown that India’s healthcare system is lacking on multiple fronts and calls for a rework by all stakeholders.
- Government expenditure on health, demand-supply mismatch, and chronic shortages are just some of the problems.
- Mint explains the gaps:

### How much does India spend on healthcare?
- In 2020-21, India spent 1.8% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare.
- With ‘health and well-being’ one of the six pillars of the Union Budget 2021-22, the government has committed approximately 2.5-3% of GDP now.
- Data shows that India has
  -  1.4 beds per 1,000 people,
  -  1 doctor per 1,445 people, and 
  -  1.7 nurses per 1,000 people.
-  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India ranks 184 out of 191 countries in health spending.
-  The US spends over 16% of its total GDP on healthcare,
-  while Japan, Canada, Germany etc. spend over 10% of their GDP on healthcare.

### How do states rank on the health index?
- The Health Index for States developed by Niti Aayog in consultation with the health ministry and the World Bank has rankings for large states, smaller states and Union territories.
- It is based on 23 health parameters ranging from mortality rate and sex ratio to functioning cardiac care units.
- In 2019, Kerala was the top performer followed by Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.
- The best incremental change was seen in Haryana, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Assam.
- The index results indicated that states even with a lower economic output are performing better on health and well-being.

### Does poor healthcare impact the economy?
- At a micro level, increased expenditure adversely impacts savings and consumption levels.
- Reduced consumption leads to reduced demand, disincentivising producers to invest more in capital formation.
- In case of firms, poor health conditions impact physical and mental ability, worker turnover, and attendance, leading to lower productivity.
- At a macro level, lower economic efficiency results in lower production relative to inputs employed, leading to lower economic growth and reduced income generation.

### What is needed to improve healthcare?
- India is in desperate need of an all-encompassing public healthcare system.
- The need of the hour is to have a regulator who can work with states and ensure that the focus shifts to affordable health-care, availability of more health-care professionals, well-equipped facilities, and disease prevention instead of disease management.
- Inequity among states in terms of facilities needs to be minimized.
- The Centre needs to aim for 100% health insurance coverage.

### How have facilities coped with the pandemic?
- Badly.
- The capacity of the healthcare system has been stretched to its limits with critical shortages of hospital beds, oxygen concentrators, life-saving drugs, medical supplies, disease surveillance etc.
- With urban India struggling to counter the onslaught of the second wave of covid-19, rural India’s threadbare healthcare system stands even more stressed.
