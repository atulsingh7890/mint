# As RIL expands, so do its subsidiaries
- Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has added 499 units and affiliates in just over four years as the refiner and chemicals maker expanded into new businesses,
- including telecom and renewable energy.
- India’s most valuable company had 88 Indian and 47 foreign units in 2016-17.
- That increased to 296 Indian and 53 foreign subsidiaries in 2020-21, according to RIL’s latest annual report.
- The number of joint venture companies, both Indian and foreign, have more than doubled from 24 in 2016-17 to 52 in 2020-21, and
- affiliate companies increased nearly fivefold from 20 in 2016-17 to 98 in 2020-21.
- These subsidiaries are spread across RIL’s businesses in petrochemicals, retail, telecom, digital services, real estate, exploration and production, textiles and media.
- “Over the past few years, RIL has been acquiring both small and big startups.
- For each such transaction, the company creates a new subsidiary.
- Also, there is a lot of investment that is happening into smaller companies or joint ventures or associate companies via subsidiaries,” said an analyst tracking RIL at a local brokerage.
- An RIL spokesperson did not reply to an email sent on Tuesday.

- Since 2016-17, RIL made $3.3 billion in acquisitions with 14% in retail, 80% in telecom, media and technology, and 6% in energy.
- Its latest acquisition was Stoke Park Ltd, a luxury property in the UK, for £57million.
- The company has made more than 30 acquisitions in the past three years in the startup space alone.
- A majority of the acquisitions were done to add value or fill gaps in RIL’s consumer offerings.
- These investments fall under the five categories of telecom, retail, education, healthcare and agriculture.
- Analysts said that with its new business segments, including digital commerce, telecom and now renewables, RIL is actively looking to acquire more startups and mature companies.
- These acquisitions lead to the formation of new units and are sometimes consolidated into a holding company.
- In October, RIL carved out its oil-to-chemicals business as a precursor to a stake sale to Saudi Aramco.
- In February last year, it consolidated its media businesses under Network18.
- In 2019, the company created Jio Platforms for its digital businesses.
- “Conglomerates like RIL have a wide corporate holding structure with multiple subsidiaries.
- However, subsidiaries are also created to mitigate and segregate risks, save taxes and channel funding or resources for specific projects,”
- said another Mumbai-based equity analyst.
