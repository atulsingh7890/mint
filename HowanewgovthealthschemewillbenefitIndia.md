# How a new govt health scheme will benefit India
- Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission,
- also known as Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PMASBY),
- that aims to strengthen India’s critical healthcare network. Mint explores:

### What is the new PMASBY scheme?
- The scheme aims to beef up health systems and institutions at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels,
- and prepare them to respond effectively to pandemics and disasters.
- The scheme comes with an outlay of about ₹64,180 crore over six years.
- This will be in addition to the National Health Mission.
- The government says health infrastructure India did not get ample attention as people,
- especially in the rural areas, have to run from pillar to post to access healthcare services,
- which worsens their condition and puts financial strain on patients. Modi said the new scheme aims to tackle this deficiency.

### Did covid-19 revive health investments?
- With covid-19 exposing gaps in India’s healthcare system, the Centre considered more schemes towards healthcare and started investing in the sector.
- Increased investments will support research on infectious diseases,
- including research to generate evidence to inform short-term and medium-term response to pandemics
- and develop core capacity to deliver the One Health Approach to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks in humans and animals.
- The National Health Policy aims to raise public health expenditure from the existing 1.15% to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025 in a time-bound manner.

### How much does India spend on health?
- According to 2020 Index report by Oxfam India, Nigeria and Bahrain secured the lowest ranks in health spending index.
- India was at the 155th position, sharing the position with Afghanistan, with both countries allocating less than 4% of their budget on health.
- The report also found that Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh spent more than India on health.
- “India’s health budget is the fourth lowest in the world.
- Just half of its population has access to even the most essential health services,” the report had said.

### How will PMASBY help bridge the gap?
- There are three major aspects of PMASBY. First is creation of facilities for diagnostics and treatment,
- under which the health and wellness centres are being opened in villages and cities.
- There will be facilities for early detection of diseases.
- Second, the testing network for the diagnosis of diseases will be boosted.
- About 730 districts of the country will get Integrated Public Health labs, for instance.
- The third aspect is the expansion and strengthening of existing research institutions that study pandemics.

### How bad is India’s healthcare infrastructure?
- Despite nominal hikes in health expenditure, India’s health statistics remain deplorable.
- According to government data,
- India has 1.4 beds per 1,000 people, 1 doctor per 1,445 people, and 1.7 nurses per 1,000 people.
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India ranks 184 out of 191 countries in health spending.
