# Is India set for a consumption boom by 2030?
- Consumption in India is expected to grow by $1.8 trillion over the next decade,
- a growth rate of approximately 6% annually in real terms, according to a research paper by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). Mint takes a look:

### What does the research paper say?
- According to the research paper, Asian consumers will account for half of the global consumption growth in the next decade.
- Densely populated Asian countries, with hyper-connected consumers, will likely offer a $10 trillion opportunity over the next decade.
- Moreover, globally, one of every two upper-middle-income and above households is expected to be in Asia,
- and one of every two purchase transactions is likely to be made by consumers in the region,
- MGI said in its ‘Beyond income: Redrawing Asia’s consumer map’ research paper, made public recently.

### How will India’s consumption grow?
- MGI expects consumption in India to grow by $1.8 trillion over the next decade, a growth rate of approximately 6% annually in real terms.
- India’s total consumption as of 2020 was estimated at around $1.9 trillion to $2 trillion.
- The estimates come as India is still reeling from the impact of the covid-19 pandemic that led to strict lockdowns and restricted mobility in Asia’s third-largest economy.
- “Growth outcomes will depend on the shape of the recovery from the pandemic and other macroeconomic factors in different geographies,” MGI said.

### How will rise in data usage affect India?
- Given the significant penetration of data and connectivity in these markets, digital natives, those born between 1980 and 2012,
- are expected to account for 40% to 50% of Asia’s consumption by 2030.
- In India, these digital natives are expected to account for at least 50% of consumption in the same period.
- A growing consumer class and access to data would push more Indians to consume digital content and shop online,
- leading to the creation of more “digital eco-systems” in the form of super apps and hyper-local delivery models.

### What does it mean for households, women?
- The next decade is also set to bring shifts in the concentration of family sizes.
- While the average size of households is shrinking across Asia, it has declined 16% from 5.5 to 4.5 people in India from 1999 to 2015.
- Also, MGI estimates suggest that increased female participation represents a $1.4 trillion gross domestic product opportunity in India.
- But this needs “structural interventions” as female labour participation decreases, and the gender pay gap increases.
- This has been further accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic.

### But how would Asia’s rise affect India?
- Nearly 55% of India’s population could be consuming class—consumers who spend upwards of $11 per day—by 2030, up from the current 24%.
- A growth in income levels could push India to contribute 27% of Asia’s consuming class.
- The share of consumers in the two highest income tiers—those spending $30 to $70 and more a day—could double to 20% by 2030 in India.
