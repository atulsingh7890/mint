# What capacity utilization says of the economy
- The results of the 53rd OBICUS show the average capacity utilization (CU) rate steadily improved from the second to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020-21,
- indicating economic recovery and improving demand conditions following the first wave of covid-19.

### What is OBICUS and its purpose?
- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) conducts a quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilization Survey (OBICUS) for the manufacturing sector.
- It includes data on new orders received,
- pending orders at the start of the quarter and at the end of the quarter,
- total inventories for work-in-progress (WiP) and finished goods (FG) at the end of the quarter and production in terms of quantity and value during the quarter,
- i.e., item-wise vis-à-vis installed capacity.
- It helps policymakers estimate CU, ratio of total inventories to sales, and the ratio of raw material and finished goods inventory to sales.


### What is capacity utilization (CU)?
- It assesses the operating efficiency of a manufacturing unit—the extent of utilization of manufacturing and productive capacities of the plant or factory.
- It is a measure of the ratio of actual output levels to the installed capacity beyond which average cost of production begins to rise.
- A CU number below 100% indicates that the organization is operating at less than full potential and can increase production without incurring additional costs associated with purchasing new machinery or land.
- Above 85% CU rate is generally considered as the optimal rate for most countries.

### During first wave, what was the trend in CU?
- With CU falling to 68.6% during the third quarter of FY20, gross domestic product (GDP) decelerated to 4.1%.
- The onslaught of the first wave of the pandemic saw CU falling sharply to 47.3% in Q1 FY21.
- However, with staggered unlock happening and the virus abating, CU for Q2 FY21 recovered and rose to 63.3%.
- Due to the impact of the coronavirus, countries worldwide have seen similar declining trends in their CU.
- The US saw its CU fall to 63.41% in April 2020 from 73.18% in March 2020.

### What’s the significance of OBICUS?
- It provides valuable inputs for monetary policy and helps policy-makers gauge demand conditions.
- With the survey showing changes in order books, inventory levels of raw materials and CU, it helps in the estimation of economic activity and inflationary pressures.
- CU responds to the overall business cycle: changes in demand lead to changes in production volumes.
- Improved CU reflects rise in consumption and also better supply chain, especially in terms of key raw materials, infrastructure support, and industrial relations.

### What do the recent results of the 53rd OBICUS say?
- The survey covering 584 manufacturing companies showed that the average CU rate had increased to 69.4 in Q4 FY21 from 66.6% in the previous quarter.
- This shows improved demand conditions after the abatement of the pandemic and the easing of the lockdown.
- New orders growth (year-on-year) after two quarters of being negative was now positive.
