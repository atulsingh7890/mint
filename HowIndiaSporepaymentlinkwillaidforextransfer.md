# How India-S’pore payment link will aid  forex  transfer
- On 14 September, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced a project to link their fast payment systems—Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and PayNow.
- Mint explains the implications of this for your foreign exchange transactions.

### What is the new payments link?
- The new project will allow users of either country’s payments system to transfer money to the other without on-boarding themselves on the other system.
- This can significantly cut down on the time taken and the costs of foreign exchange transfers to Singapore.
- The project is to be operationalized in July 2022.
- The linkage builds upon the National Payments Corporation of India’s (NPCI’s) partnership with Singapore’s Liquid Group,
- which may allow BHIM app users to make UPI-QR code-based payments at merchants in North Asia and South-East Asia from early 2022.

### How is money transferred  at  present?
- Indian residents can send up to $250,000 per year outside India under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) of RBI.
- This is currently done in most banks by filling up lengthy paper forms.
- The bank provides a foreign exchange quote, which can be quite steep for individuals sending small amounts of money.
- Thereafter, you can make the transfer through your nearest bank branch.
- The money is then sent through the SWIFT system.
- Some banks offer this process through net banking.
- You can also make payments to foreign merchants through credit cards.
- However, you cannot transfer money abroad through UPI.

### What about taxes and reporting?
- People remitting money need to fill up the LRS form and mention the reason for remitting the money.
- They have to also ensure that the amount sent is less than $250,000 per year.
- In addition, tax collected at source (TCS) of 5% is imposed on LRS transfers above ₹7 lakh.
- A single UPI transfer is capped at ₹1 lakh.
- TCS will become applicable if the cumulative amount through such transfers crosses ₹7 lakh per year.
- In addition, forex charges for small transfers are quite high.
- It is not clear if they will continue to be so for transfers through the new link.

### What are the other innovations at play?
- Under RBI’s regulatory sandbox, firms have been allowed to test other forex solutions.
- Cashfree is also testing the use of UPI for LRS transfers for foreign investment purposes in partnership with fin-techs.
- The technology would allow you to transfer rupees to a fintech firm and receive corresponding amount in foreign currency in your overseas broking account,
- after adjusting for fees and conversion charges.
- Open Financial Technologies is experimenting with a blockchain-based solution to help exporters from India.

### What about the costs involved in forex transfers?
- Banks levy hefty charges for transfers of small amounts of foreign exchange.
- The UPI-Pay Now link has the potential to slash costs and the time taken for such transfers.
- However, the rupee is a partially convertible currency with limited liquidity in global currency markets.
- Hence, forex mark ups or spreads levied by banks may not disappear altogether.
