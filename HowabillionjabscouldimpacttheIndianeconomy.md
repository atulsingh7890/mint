# How a billion jabs could impact the Indian economy
- With India having met the timelines that it had set for administering over one billion covid-19 vaccines,
- it is important to explore its potential impact on the country’s economic prospects.
- Mint explains the impact on consumption and the supply-chain.

### What is India’s achievement?
- On 21 October, the country administered over one billion covid-19 vaccine doses in about nine months.
- Due to limited production capacity, the vaccination programme started with a selective approach—covid warriors and front-line workers,
- to begin with, followed by senior citizens, and then the 18-plus adult population.
- It has since traversed a long path, with the credibility of scientists and the ability of the government being initially questioned.
- India is now the second country to achieve one billion doses globally after China.
- Both nations have billion-plus populations.

### How will it help the demand side?
- With over 75% of adults administered at least one dose and 30% fully vaccinated, people have begun venturing out,
- thereby driving up business for restaurants, shopping centres, marketplaces etc.
- There could be a dramatic shift back to offline shopping, resulting in a new normal—i.e. a mix between offline and online for retail.
- The synergy between entertainment, bonding in the family, and the satisfaction of being in touch with the outside world may result in discretionary spending.
- Families may end up buying more than what was planned.

### What’s the likely effect on the supply-chain?
- With pent-up demand picking up, manufacturers will try to meet market expectations.
- This will drive up capacity utilization.
- With the government aiming to fully vaccinate its adult population, social distancing norms are likely to be liberalized.
- Factories will thereby be able to increase production levels.
- With investor-friendly policies lined up, there should not be any supply-chain constraints, going ahead—except perhaps stress from rising global commodity prices and semiconductor shortages.

### Will it boost the nation’s confidence?
- Key macroeconomic indicators are fast moving into green resulting in growth estimates for the economy being revised upwards.
- More than a pick-up in consumption demand and matching investment levels by industry,
- the lively pace of vaccination will act as a booster for the confidence of the nation as a whole.
- Policy makers are likely to announce additional reform measures, which may inspire confidence in both domestic and foreign investors.

### Anything more in the vaccination pipeline?
- The focus of the government and health administrators now is on vaccination of children between 2-18 years of age.
- Zydus Cadila’s Zycov-D and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin are being considered for this younger age group.
- It could change the momentum in every walk of life—family, workplace, and markets—and instil confidence.
