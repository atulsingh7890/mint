# Lessons in CCI’s fine on Maruti for other companies
- The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered Maruti Suzuki India Ltd to pay a fine of ₹200 crore for allegedly controlling discounts offered by its dealers,
- stifling market competition.
- The carmaker has denied the allegations. Mint takes a look:

### What is the Maruti Suzuki discount case?
- It involves a discount control policy that allegedly restricted its dealers from giving discounts without its permission, over certain pre-restricted level.
- CCI found that this amounted to ‘resale price maintenance’ which is banned under the Competition Act.
- The law prohibits agreements between enterprises at different stages of the production chain regarding aspects such as supply, storage or price that causes appreciable adverse effect on competition.
- That includes carmakers and dealers too.
- CCI’s case is that curbing discounts affects the final price to consumers as well as intra-company and inter-company competition.

### Why did CCI find it anti-competitive?
- According to the CCI order, resale price maintenance can prevent effective competition both at the intra-brand level as well as at the inter-brand level.
- When a producer imposes a minimum resale price maintenance obligation on dealers, they are prevented from lowering the sale prices beyond the imposed limit.
- This prevents them from competing effectively on price.
- Stifling intra-brand competition among dealers of the same firm results in higher prices.
- When a firm with significant market share imposes minimum selling price on dealers,
- it can decrease the pricing pressure on competing firms and thus affect inter-brand competition.

### How important is market share?
- **The scope of CCI’s** probe is confined to the extent to which a discount offered by a firm lessens or eliminates competition.
- Given that Maruti owns more than 50% of the market, any reductions imposed by it will undoubtedly affect market competitiveness,” said Sonam Chandwani, managing partner, KS Legal & Associates.
- The firm informed CCI that the probe has erroneously concluded that because it has 51% market share, it has market power.
- CCI can levy a fine up to 10% of the average turn-over of past 3 years in such a case.

### What are the key areas CCI regulates?
- CCI seeks to check behaviour among enterprises that are anticompetitive in nature, including cartelization, predatory pricing, bid-rigging, and the abuse of dominance.
- In certain industries where there are fewer players and cross-holdings among them, chances of anti-competitive practices are high.
- The cement industry has in the past faced probes by CCI.
- The changing nature of the economy, especially the rise of digital economy, has brought new areas for it to keep a close watch. CCI also clears M&As.

### What does the carmaker say about the order?
- Maruti has denied the charges and told the regulator that no discount control policy was placed in effect by it and that dealers were free to offer any discounts.
- A Maruti spokesperson said the firm is examining the order and would take appropriate actions under the law.
- Maruti has always worked in the best interests of consumers and will continue to do so in the future.
