# Let’s chat, but your WhatsApp has a new policy
- WhatsApp’s controversial new privacy policy goes live on 15 May,
- despite pushback from users and governments.
- However, the company has made some changes to how the policy will be enforced. Mint takes a look at the new changes.

### Why did the policy create controversy?
- When it first came out in January, many thought that the new privacy policy would allow WhatsApp to see users’ private messages,
- and that the company could share such messages with its parent company, Facebook Inc.
- More importantly, the policy was conveyed to users as an ultimatum, giving them till 8 February to accept the new policy or
- lose access to the social messaging app.
- WhatsApp had later claimed that the new policy does not affect users’ private messages, deferred the update to 15 May, and said it would provide more information on the policy.

### Can you choose to not accept the policy?
- WhatsApp has clarified that no accounts will be deleted or deactivated for not accepting the platform’s new policy by 15 May.
- However, the company’s reminders to users about accepting the policy will become “persistent” after “several weeks”.
- Users will be able to answer incoming calls during this time and get notifications for incoming chats, which they will be able to respond to.
- However, they won’t be able to access the actual chat list on the platform.
- Eventually, the platform will remove the ability to receive calls or notifications and you will not be able to send messages.

### What is the regulatory stance on this?
- The Centre had written to WhatsApp, asking the platform to withdraw its policy.
- In a letter to WhatsApp in January, the Centre said the policy may be in violation of the country’s upcoming data protection laws.
- The Centre had alleged that the policy violated the country’s IT rules and urged the Delhi high court to restrain the app from implementing it.
- The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had also decided to take “suo moto cognizance” of the matter in March, which WhatsApp tried to oppose.

### Are there alternatives to WhatsApp?
- Apps such as Signal and Telegram have gained popularity since the controversy.
- The two platforms, which also offer end-to-end encrypted services, have been downloaded millions of times since January this year, though neither platform comes close to the user base that WhatsApp has now.
- Less-known apps such as Threema and Wire have also been recommended. Most data sources suggest that WhatsApp’s user base in India has remained largely unaffected by the controversy.

## What is WhatsApp’s stance on the matter?
- The social messaging platform has said that the new privacy policy does not affect users’ private messages and is an effort at being clearer about upcoming business features.
- The Facebook-owned company claims that the new terms of service do not change what data WhatsApp can access and what it retains.
