# What UAE and Opec+ impasse means for India
- Oil climbed to $77.16 a barrel on 5 July,
- its highest in nearly three years, and was trading at $75.65 a barrel on Wednesday as a result of a deadlock over the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE’s) production quota.
- How will this impasse affect India? Mint decodes:

### What is the origin of the deadlock?
- In April 2020, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (Opec+) entered into a two-year agreement for steep cuts in crude oil production to manage the sharp fall in crude oil prices.
- The price of Brent crude had that month fallen to an 18-year low of under $20 per barrel as the world went into lockdown to contain the covid-19 pandemic.
- In November 2020, the price of Brent crude began rising as countries began rolling out vaccination drives.
- But Opec+ maintained lower levels of production with Saudi Arabia announcing a further cut in production of 1 million barrels per day for the February-April period.

### Why is there an impasse?
- According to the Emirates News Agency, the UAE believes that the market needs to augment production and supports an increase from August.
- But the Opec joint ministerial monitoring committee (JMMC) has put forth the option of increasing production on the condition of an extension to the current agreement,
- which would extend the UAE’s reference production baseline till December 2022, from the existing agreement end date of April 2022.
- While the UAE proposed to decouple the matters of increasing production and the extension of the agreement, the JMMC insisted on coupling them, leading to a stalemate.

### How will this impact fuel prices in India?
- If the UAE and Opec+ fail to reach an agreement to increase production in August,
- India’s hope of relief from a possible decline in crude prices could be delayed.
- Indian consumers are currently facing record-high prices of petrol and diesel, with retail fuel prices crossing the ₹100 per litre mark in many states and Union territories, including the national capital and most major metros.
- Higher crude prices may lead fuel prices to rise further, stoking inflation in addition to impacting consumption.

### How much does India import from Opec+?
- India is the world’s third-largest crude oil buyer and the fourth-largest LNG importer.
- Opec+ makes up about 83% of India’s oil imports.
- In 2019-20, it imported 227 million tonnes of crude oil.
- India has its own basket of crude suitable to its refineries, which comprises the Oman, Dubai and Brent crude.
- The country’s import bill stood at ₹5.42 trillion in 2016-17 and increased to ₹8.43 trillion in 2019-20.
- Every dollar increase in the price of crude raises India’s import bill by ₹10,700 crore on an annualized basis.

### Does the market need more crude oil?
- As countries lift curbs, the markets need greater oil supply.
- According to S&P Global Platts Analytics, with global demand set to grow by 4.2 million barrels per day by August, the lack of a deal could cause more tightness than expected in August.
- On the other hand, a near-term compromise would provide the market with greater supply in August and September.
