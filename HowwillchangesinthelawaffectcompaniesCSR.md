# How will changes in the law affect companies’ CSR?
- Parliament has passed amendments to the Companies Act to strengthen laws governing corporate social responsibility (CSR). 
- Mint delves into the changes that have left Indian companies unamused as they face higher compliance and management costs.

### What are the laws governing CSR ?
- The laws governing CSR come under the Companies Act, 2013, and became effective on 1 April 2014.
- These laws state that companies with a net worth of ₹500 crore or revenue of ₹1,000 crore or net profit of ₹5 crore during the immediately preceding fiscal.
- should spend 2% of their average net profit in the last three years on activities related to social development
- such as sanitation, education, eradication of hunger, poverty and malnutrition, conservation of heritage, art and culture, and vocational training such as setting up grooming outlets or training centres for sewing.


### What are the changes in the law?
- Till now, if a company was unable to fully incur the CSR expenditure in a given year,
- it could carry this amount forward and spend it in the next 12 months, in addition to the money for that year.
- Under the new laws, any unspent amount will have to be deposited into an escrow account within 30 days of the end of that fiscal.
- This amount will have to be spent within three years from the date of its transfer,
- failing which it will be put into a fund, which could even be the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.
- The government also plans to include a specific penal provision in the Companies Act in case of non-compliance with CSR.

### What are the penalties?
- Companies violating CSR norms will attract fines ranging from ₹50,000 to ₹25 lakh,
- with the officers concerned liable for imprisonment of up to three years, according to the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2019.


### What are the objections to the proposed amendments?
- The proposed changes come in an environment where profit has become a dirty word.
- Starting from the budget, which increased taxes on the rich, this is seen as another move aimed at penalizing the private sector.
- There’s a sense that the government is unloading its responsibilities on the private sector.
- The new provisions are also tantamount to raising taxes on companies as they would be penalized for not spending the full CSR amount.
- The move will also increase costs for companies.


### What paraphernalia do companies need to ensure CSR compliance?
- Listed firms need to disclose their CSR activities, amount spent and framework created to ensure adherence to norms.
- They have a CSR team that provides a regular progress report and updates to the CSR committee of the board.
- The committee is also given a report of the activities undertaken each quarter, along with targets and reasons for variance, if any.
- All this needs to be submitted to the corporate affairs ministry.
- The list of activities constituting CSR and what does not is subjective.
