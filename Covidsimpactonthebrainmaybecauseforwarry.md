# Covid’s impact on the brain may be cause for worry
- Covid-19’s impact on our health has been discussed a lot—it can cause weakness, respiratory issues, fever, sore throat, rashes etc.
- However, its impact on the brain has been spoken about only in terms of headache, brain fog, or a loss of smell and taste.
- But a recent study reveals more.

### How much did we know so far?
- Covid’s impact on brain has a much wider scope than previously believed.
- When the pandemic began, one of the distinct signs that health experts noticed was the loss of smell and taste,
- often even before or without signs of respiratory distress.
- Other neurological symptoms were soon noticed as well, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fatigue.
- Dr. Kiran T. Thakur, a neurologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York,
- had told The Washington Post that “viruses that invade the brain are tough to eradicate because a barrier protects the brain from the rest of the body.”

### What does the new study reveal?
- Last week, medRxiv released a pre-print version (which has not been peer-reviewed yet) of a research paper showing that people suffering from covid-19 had significant losses of grey matter surrounding the olfactory and gustatory system.
- Imaging-derived phenotypes of the participants revealed loss of grey matter in regions associated with memory in the left hemisphere and the temporal pole of the right hemisphere.
- It compared data from pre-infection imaging to data taken post infection, letting it avoid the risk of pre-existing conditions which could have been misinter-preted as an outcome of the disease.

### How was the study conducted?
- The study used data gathered by UK Biobank, a long-term research and data centre that collects in-depth genetic and health details.
- It scanned 40,000 participants before the start of the pandemic.
- This year, it called back hundreds of those who had been scanned for a second imaging visit.
- Researchers then used multimodal data from 782 participants from the re-imaging study.
- Over 390 of them tested positive between the scans.
- They then compared structural and functional brain scans to compare longitudinal brain changes.

### Has any other virus had a similar effect?
- Sars-Cov-2, which causes covid-19, is not the only one which has impacted our brains.
- Many other infections similarly affect the nervous system.
- For example, Dr Gabriel A. de Erausquin, a professor of neurology at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, has said, “Since the flu pandemic of 1917 and 1918, many of the flu-like diseases have been associated with brain disorders.”
- Measles, HIV, herpes, polio all can lead to fatal outcomes.
- However, these are all infections.

### Why are the new findings worrying?
- Volume change in grey matter is only one of the brain conditions caused by covid.
- Authors of the study also believe that the brain volume loss lasts much longer than the actual infection.
- Besides, unlike what was previously believed, it can be noticed even in those with mild cases of covid-19,
- though, the loss of grey matter was seen to increase with the severity of the infection.
