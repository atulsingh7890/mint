# Economic revival key to reducing unemployment
- Joblessness has soared for the week ending 30 May, with urban India hitting a high, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).
- The Labour force participation rate too has fallen, signalling the need to revive economic activities. Mint explains:

### What is India’s unemployment rate?
- Regional lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the second wave of covid-19 infections have seen unemployment rate in the country soar to 11.9% in May as against 7.97% in April and 6.5% in March 2021.
- In the week ended 30 May, the rate rose to 12.15%, even as it touched a high of 17.88% in urban India.
- However, as CMIE estimates are based on a small sample size, which might give a macro picture of the latest unemployment trends, data given by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)—based on door-to-door collection—might be considered for an in-depth analysis.

### What is labour force participation rate?
- The labour force participation rate (LFPR) is a measure of the proportion of a country’s working-age population that is actively engaged in the labour market.
- It is calculated by expressing the number of persons in the labour force as a percentage of the working-age population.
- LFPR dropped to 35.69% and 40.61% in the week ended 30 May for urban and rural India, respectively, from 37% and 42.33% in the week ended 16 May.
- Declining LFPR is indicative of the fact that individuals are withdrawing from the labour market and not looking for jobs. This can be worrisome for an economy.

### How has the second wave impacted jobs?
- With the Indian economy growing at 1.6% in Q4FY21, net payroll data of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization showed the number of new subscribers stayed flat at 1.12 million in February and March.
- But localized lockdowns led to a spurt in joblessness in April and May 2021.
- Low business sentiment, curtailed economic activities and the fear of contracting the virus resulted in people migrating from urban India to villages.
- But rural areas were unable to offer employment, other than manual work under the MGNREGS.

### What measures can be adopted?
- Quick short- and medium-term steps include resuming economic activities in a graded manner and aiming for universal vaccination at the earliest.
- Jabs will help improve consumer confidence and lead to increase in demand and availability of labour which in turn will have a positive impact on production and business sentiment.
- Improved business confidence will result in increased job opportunities, thereby setting the cycle of demand and supply in motion.


### How does India compare to the rest of the world?
- According to the International Labour Organization, India’s unemployment in 2020 was 7.11% while the global average was 6.47%.
- Neighbours China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan had unemployment rates of 5.0%, 5.3%, 4.48%, 4.65%, 4.44% and 3.74%, respectively.
- The US had an unemployment rate of 8.31%, higher than India.
