# What is fuelling the stellar run in ethereum ?
Ether, a cryptocurrency built on the ethereum blockchain, has zoomed 400% since early 2021 to approach $4,000, against a 100% gain in bitcoin in the same period.
Mint looks at the platform on which ether is built, and why experts are more bullish on it than bitcoin.

### What is ethereum, and how does it work?
- Ethereum, a blockchain proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, is an open-source platform for decentralized applications.
- On this platform, software developers write smart contracts that control digital value through a set of criteria and are accessible anywhere in the world.
- Ethereum allows you to move money directly, bypassing traditional financial services companies.
- Ether, on the other hand, is like money and can be used for everyday transactions similar to bitcoin.
- Since its launch in 2015, ether has become one of the most popular alternatives to bitcoin, commanding a market capitalization of over $450 billion.

### What is a smart contract ?
- A smart contract is a programmable contract that runs on the ethereum blockchain, that allows two parties to set conditions of a transaction without needing a third party for execution.
- Smart contracts work like regular contracts, but can automatically enforce the rule via a code.
- While bitcoin was the first to use smart contracts, the ethereum platform has more real-world applications.
- One such use is non-fungible tokens or NFTs.
- These are smart contracts that can be used to track ownership of real-world items or digital collections.
- But, in the absence of regulations, it is unclear how these smart contracts can be enforced in India.

### Is Ethereum more environment Friendly ?
- Major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum use proof of work (PoW) to verify transactions on the blockchain.
- This process uses an advanced form of mathematics, which only powerful computers can solve, resulting in significant usage of electricity.
- This is one of the reasons why ethereum is moving to proof of stake (PoS).
- This process means that the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power they have.
- It’s supposed to improve the verification process and energy efficiency.

### Why has ethereum diverged from bitcoin ?
- There are multiple factors working in favour of ether.
- Over the past year, a lot of investors who got into bitcoin have become aware of ether and started diversifying their crypto portfolios.
- Over the last year, ether has surged close to 1,800%, against a 500% jump in bitcoin.
- The launch of ethereum exchange-traded fund on a Canadian exchange has been seen as a major step towards making digital assets mainstream.
- While bitcoin’s most well-known use case is a store of value, ethereum has several real-world applications.

### What is Gas in ethereum blockchain ?
- According to ethereum.org, Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the ethereum network.
- For making transactions and executing smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain, one needs to pay a fee called Gas, which is paid entirely in ether or ETH.
